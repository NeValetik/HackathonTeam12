            "PLEEEEEASE people, stop complaining about the display and things like that, the display is just AMAZING!! By looking at the low rating of the item, I was really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it. I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months. Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty. It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need! The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice. I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods. The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME). The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day. The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price. I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need. Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.

Super easy to edit videos with the samsung editor, much smoother than google photos for longer videos. Ive only had it a week but very happy so far. Read more",
            "This Samsung phone has been my absolute favorite device up to this day. It's expensive no denying that but in this economy what isn't. Got it on a promotion to get more memory for less money and a 200 dollar gift card. Love the gold color and it's size. The camera is the best in my opinion with the zoom capabilities. It's fast and has an incredibly gorgeous screen with the included s pen. Battery life is incredible, Will probably keep this phone for some years unless Samsung can wow me with the s25 in the future. Highly recommend this device dare I say better than any apple phone ived used but that's just my opinion. Read more",
            "This mobile device has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance and versatility. It is capable of handling a wide range of tasks and applications with remarkable efficiency. One of the standout features of the S24 is its exceptional ability to maintain a strong and reliable cellular signal, even in remote and rural locations. Unlike my previous device, the S21, which frequently experienced signal loss in these areas, the S24 has proven to be consistently dependable, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity. It is important to acknowledge that cellular service quality can vary across different regions and network providers. However, based on my personal experience, the S24 has demonstrated exceptional performance in maintaining a stable cellular connection in challenging signal environments. Read more",

            "This is a very nice phone. Samsung did a really good job on this one. The build quality is solid. The plastic case is a matte iridescent deep blackish blue and does a good job at not showing fingerprints. The AMOLED screen has good colors and perfect deep blacks. The high capacity battery (5,000mAh) lasts 7-10 days with light usage before needing to recharge. The software is typical Samsung high-quality and the Samsung-built email app is still the best amongst Android phones. The fingerprint reader on the side unlocks the phone instantaneously. The charging port is USB-C. Speed-wise, the phone is plenty fast and doesn't lag. It has 5G cell phone connectivity but you can turn it off and use 4G to save on battery life. Networking also supports 2G (i.e. GSM) that can be turned on or off. Built-in storage is a whopping 128GB. Expansion-wise, the SIM tray accepts 2 SIM cards (i.e. this is indeed a dual-SIM phone), or 1 SIM card + 1 Micro-SD card. There is a headphone jack at the bottom, next to the charging port. The phone is quite big, i.e. the screen is huge, and it's rather heavy but so are most phones nowadays. It barely fits in my pants pockets. This is marketed as an entry-level phone, but honestly, it has such much memory, long battery life, fingerprint unlock, 3 good cameras, dual-SIM, Micro-SD expansion, headphone jack, USB C, great software support, future-proof updates, and is quite fast, so you may wonder why you'd ever need to buy anything more expensive. Overall, great modern phone at a reasonable price ($200) that should work well for most people and last a long time. Read more",
            "I bought this Samsung A15 as a replacement for a Motorola ACE 5g that became intermittent with connecting with cell towers. Even though the Samsung is several years newer it feels slower than the Motorola. The screen looks GREAT (!) with vivid colors, clear images and good viewing angles. The processor though . . (uhg) feels slow. Maybe it's the low cache, or MediaTek chip, but overall the phone has a slowness to it with texting, switching apps, or gaming. If you want a phone for viewing the web or videos this phone still does ok. Read more",
            "Good phone for a low cost. Everything transfered smoothly. I have T- Mobile and I'm in the USA. Good photos and videos. Smooth scrolling. Not too many crazy updates. I like the ability to remove most preinstalled apps as well. Battery life is great. Downfalls are minimal. *Side on/off button is flush with the side and takes longer to locate. *screenshot are rather difficult with the palm swipe. It takes quite a few tries, loosing what you want to screenshot happens often. As an older person I screenshot things I can't read so I can zoom in. I try to avoid that now. *No sd card storage to remove or replace. I miss that, even though the phone has lots of available room. I use to save the sd cards for personal back up photos. *Sim card slot looks as if it won't securely hold in the tray. Isn't a tight fit, but suprisingly it does work with some patience. A month into use, It's a good phone so far! Read more",
            "Excellent value phone for money. I have used A14 Samsung phone prior and I didn't think it was that slow or bad, only the screen was not very good but this phone definitely a great budget phone. This A15 phone has oled screen so the screen is excellent like the more expensive Samsung phones , battery life is excellent, calls and texts works great on Tmobile. The only thing is the processing speed is somewhat slower but not that bad for everyday functions, some internet browsing, using apps... no regret. Read more",
            "Why they released this with 4 GB RAM while in Europe and Asia they have 6/8 GB RAM versions is mind boggling. I kept losing GPS and 5G signal. People could not hear me on the other end and the lag was awful, also many apps opened by themselves. As a delivery driver this phone almost cost me my job. Switched back to Motorola Power 5G 2024 and I am back on track. I wanted Samsung to work because I like their watches and you need a Galaxy phone to use their ECG and other health app features. Back to Fitbit!! Read more",

            "I went with this Samsung phone because I liked that it will receive updates for a long time. I hate getting rid of phones that work just fine because they stop supporting them. But this phone is slower than the old pone I am getting rid of. I liked everything else about it. The Samsung One UI is cool. Screen is nice. But the processor is so underpowered it is frustrating to do anything on the phone. I ended up getting a new phone and I am going to sell this on eBay. You are better off with a used Pixel than this thing. Read more",
            "After being an Apple customer for several years, I am starting to get tired of constantly having to get a new phone at a cost of about $1000 every few years. My phones tend to last longer than the software upgrades allow. I still have a working iPhone 3GS that can be used. I even bought a SIMM conversion kit to test it. It still works, but not much good for anything else but playing my music library. This phone is my delve into the Android world, and at a little over $200 this phone seems to work great. I only did the basic setup, and haven’t logged it into any accounts like Google or Samsung, but I can insert the SIMM card, and use it like an old fashioned phone, should my aging iPhone 8 fail on me. Right now, I am trying to decide about whether to shell out for another Apple product or just go with Samsung, like a lot of others have done, according to recent news about how Apple is losing market share to Samsung. After I get a chance to play around with the phone a little more, I will probably update this review. Read more"

            "I got this to replace my S9 that I had for 5 years. I was skeptical to move from the S to the A series, but am pleased that I didn't give up any quality. I really like the new phone. The data transfer was so easy and even brought in my apps & saved most of my progress on games. The screen quality and picture quality is excellent. My favorite feature is the speaker volume. My S9 was never loud enough and I find I have to turn down the top volume when using the speaker - it's too loud which is fantastic. I also like the fingerprint recognition being integrated with the power-on button. Read more",
            "I bought this phone for my mother since she broke her old one. It is a nice looking phone and I liked how it had borders instead of that weird curve the Galaxy S 22 ultras have. Although it's a nice looking phone, the description of the phone is deceitful. It claims to be unlocked however, this phone is only truly unlocked OUTSIDE the U.S. It will work if your provider is T-Mobile or Metro, but if you have Spectrum Mobile, you're out of luck. I think it's wrong that the seller claims that the phone is unlocked when it only works with certain providers. I put a request to return it same day. Read more",
            "I got this to replace a 2-year-old Moto G power. The ratings and reviews said that the Samsung a15 had great battery life which is the single most important thing to me. I have been completely happy with this phone for a couple of weeks now. The screen is much brighter than most, which I like. I love many of the things Samsung has done with its software including adaptive screen brightness. It is a tremendous value. The only thing I'm not happy with is that when you use wired earbuds, the sound stutters at lower volumes unless it has a 3.5 mm plug with four sections instead of three. Earbuds with microphones have four sections. So I can't use my old earbuds, I ordered some new ones with microphones (and they work perfectly). Other than that, it is snappy, has plenty of RAM, plenty of storage, the fingerprint sensor works well, the cameras are pretty good and Samsung seems to be good about updates. Another of my essential criteria is no 5g. 5G is proven dangerous and I don't want to be anywhere near it. While this is 5G capable on certain networks, you can turn it off which is wonderful! You certainly can't go wrong for $170! Read more",

            "Having been a loyal Google Pixel user for the past five years, I recently upgraded to the Google Pixel 8, and I couldn't be more pleased with my decision - especially at this all time low price. Firstly, let me express my admiration for the Pixel 3a, which has served me exceptionally well over the years. Its standout feature, the battery life, has remained remarkably robust, still performing at around 90% of its original capacity after five years of use - a testament to Google's commitment to quality. Now, onto the Pixel 8. What immediately struck me was the stunning improvement in screen performance, especially in direct sunlight. The enhanced visibility makes using the phone outdoors a breeze, and it's a significant upgrade from the Pixel 3a. Moreover, the overall experience with the Pixel 8 has been nothing short of delightful. The sleek design, smooth performance, and intuitive user interface continue to uphold Google's reputation for delivering top-notch smartphones. In summary, if you're considering an upgrade, the Pixel 8 is undoubtedly worth it. Highly recommended! Read more",
            "Phone itself is probably the best cost to performance phone on the market. It does everything a modern phone needs to do: has a great camera, reasonable battery, thumbprint and face unlock, awesome display, large storage capacity. For the price it doesn't really get better. I was specifically worried about the refurbished quality. Instead of rolling the dice I opted for the slightly more expensive option \"like new\" instead of \"good\". It arrived in slightly beat up packaging that might not be worthy for display on the shelf, but otherwise everything in the box was included like it was a brand new phone. Zero cosmetic damage to the screen or case body. Functions perfectly. Was unlocked like stated in the listing and I was able to change my sim card from an iphone without going in to the store. I will update if I run into any other problems, but from now I will be more trusting of Amazon refurbished products wouldn't be afraid to buy good quality, but still feel it's risky on big purchases to go any worse than that. 1 star for face recognition because I haven't tried it yet.

            "Super smart device, has some extremely intuitive features and simplifies things for you in many ways. I've always used Samsung, so coming from this I was a little nervous, but after you get the hang of the gestures and stuff, it's SUPER cohesive and fluid. The search functions, summarization capabilities, AI tech, etc are all great. Battery life is pretty good as well, nothing to complain about from me. It'll last, from full charge, for about a day and some change with moderate use. And that camera.. WOW. The camera itself is already amazing, but they basically process it right after you take it with AI to sharpen and enhance it, and it makes for some of the best pictures I've ever seen come from a smartphone. It has this thing called the magic editor, which let's you use some AI tools to make adjustments to images, and that's absolutely mind-blowing to use. All around an awesome phone. I DID get it on sale for about $500, but I still think if you're able to afford it, this is a great choice. Read more",
            "This smartphone feels amazing in hands and coming from a 6.55\" block, it is like a day and night in weight and size. It fits very well my pockets. The screen is pretty smooth, Pixel UI is very clean and minimalistic, without all the nonsense and infinite options that characterize chinese Ui like Miui or ColorOs. Color otherwise is kind of dull, not vivid and there isn't too much options to change. Camera is Amazing and I see why Pixels compete hand to hand with Iphone; my device basically saved our Christmas diner photo since the Iphone couldn't so much back lighting while the Pixel got an outstanding photo with just one click. Everything feels smooth, especially at 120 Hz but even at 60, it feels greats. Google photo AI editor, magic eraser and noise eraser are amazing tools, I could even use magic editor to erase some numbers from an image for a University project. Now the bad parts about this phone: Chip isn't the most efficient, sometimes it even gets hot easily with minimal tasks, and even worse when using LTE (not 5g since in my country that technology isn't working). I can easily see the difference in battery health when using data instead wifi. without battery saver,this device will lasts like 4 or 5 hours. It is so underwhelming since this is the only way to e joy the 120 Hz refresh rate. With battery saver, things get better and you can accomplish like 6 to 8 hours, but by dimming the phone capabilities.finally the worst part of this phone is the lacking 27w to charge which basically take between 1.5 hours to 2. It is so disappointing that a 2023 Smartphone charges so slowly and with a horrible barrery management your battery depletes like water ins hands. Just to look at the screen You've already lost 1%. So I would recommended this device just to people who prioritizes camera over battery and performance and those who can live with a charger 24/7 (charger not included 🥴). Read more",

My old phone couldn't be used in direct sunlight, this AMOLED display is phenomenal, HD, bright and readable in any light.  This makes using the cameras during the day very easy, regardless of the setting. The stereo speakers sound crisp and clear, and the response from the Exynos 1280 processor is fast. Battery life is great, and transfer app made switching to the new phone the easiest process yet.  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to my friends. Read more",
            "BUYER BEWARE. Read the negative reviews about the A25. Apparently, the shutting off/connection problems are a known issue and are non-repairable. Days after the 30-day return window closed, my son's phone kept turning off. Call Samsung customer service and the representative says it is because we aren't using the correct Samsung charger. Bought two of the recommended chargers and they are EXACTLY like the two we already own. What a waste of money! Continued to have phone issues. Contact Samsung customer service and they say to return it for repair. Next we get an email saying phone received by Samsung repair department but they don't have the needed part and it will take 10 days for them to get it. Update: (May 10, 2024), we get an email stating the phone is being returned -- UNREPAIRED. No explanation, just an 800 number to call for more info.  Called, complained, told they'd look into it. Called, complained, told it was being referred to another department. Update: (May 24, 2024) After weeks of complaining and being jerked around, we finally get a text that we'll get a cash refund. Heaven knows how long it will take to actually get it. We will replace the defective Samsung A25 with a different model. Meanwhile, we hold our breath and hope our second A25 lasts more than a few months. For years, we've been fans of Samsung products, having owned a number of Samsung televisions, monitors, tablets, phones. Samsung was our go-to for electronic entertainment. Normally, we love the products but the customer service is definitely third-rate at best. We hope the experience we had with the A25 is an isolated one and not a predictor of the way Samsung's business is heading. Read more",
            "TL;DR: Nice phone with a few common-sense features, and several issues. I'm an undemanding user, and my old A01 showed its age at the end of its support life. It began lagging more and more. Storage was full and apps wouldn't update because there supposedly wasn't enough space, regardless of the size of SD card I installed. The very definition of \"planned obsolescence\". Wanting to avoid this with my next phone, I bought something with more storage and memory this time around. SCREEN: After 2 Galaxy A15's had phantom screen press issues I decided to give the A25 a try since online resources suggested it had a different screen. Thankfully I've yet to have any phantom screen press issues about 2 months since receipt. Per gsmarena.com the A15's features a 800-nit screen, while the A25 features a 1000-nit screen. The noticeable difference here is that the A25 is actually usable in sunlight. The A15 is too dim. This is very important, and I feel a huge drawback of the A15. BATTERY: I subjectively feel like the A25 runs down the battery a bit faster than the A15. This does make sense given the hardware. Per nanoreview.net the SOC of this phone is more powerful than that of the A15, with a lower battery life rating. Per gsmarena.com the A25 has a 120Hz screen vs. the 90Hz of the A15, while both phones feature 5000 mAh batteries. Either someone at Google decided to finally build battery charge thresholds into Android after 14 versions (better late than never?), or this phone, due to price point and/or hardware, supports them. This should help improve battery lifespan of this phone. Neither the A15 or A25 feature wireless charging. I don't care. You might. HARDWARE: I DO care that both feature 3.5mm jacks. They make life so much better. Locating it on the bottom, unlike the A01's top-mounted 3.5mm jack, makes it easier to route a cable when it's in a pocket or car mount. It supports either dual SIM or one SIM and a microSDXC. This also makes life much better. I wish it could hold 2 SIMs AND a microSDXC at once, but it's better than nothing I suppose. The cameras are pretty good, but get grainy/pixelated when zooming in. My camera needs are modest compared to some, so I'm satisfied. The notch for the front camera is fine. In fact I grew to like the status info (battery, WiFi/cellular, notification icons, etc) being at the top, next to the notch, in the A01, giving more room to apps. The inclusion of stereo loudspeakers is a nice upgrade from the A15, especially considering the price increase. If you hold the phone at an off-angle they can sound strange due to the angle. For best results hold the phone with the screen flat toward your face. It gets a bit warmer than the A15. A quick internet search suggests it's the Exynos SOC. Thumbs down. I'm not particularly tough on my phones, so the plastic construction is fine for me. I put it in a silicone case. This makes it easier to grab, and was potentially far less expensive than buying a phone with metal construction. SIZE: The phone's too big*. The A01 was too big at 5.7\", and the A25 is worse 6.5\". I have long fingers and it's impossible to reach the top of the screen (where one might find a close or menu button in an app) one-handed without major grip adjustment, risking dropping the phone. The A01 was borderline uncomfortable in the (large) pockets of my pants, the A15/A25 cross the border. Squatting down must be carefully done lest it dig into your hip and cause discomfort or pain. Yes viewing more of web pages is nice. Yes I have to thumb to the next page of ebooks less when there are more words on-screen. Yes, more screen real estate is nice for Google Maps. But I don't NEED those things. In fact, I'd rather have an easier-to-carry PHONE, not a PHABLET I have to buy military cargo pants or a purse to comfortably carry. SOFTWARE: Mostly stable and as-expected: minimal changes to Android and the usual Samsung bloatware. There are some issues but I'm not sure if I can blame Samsung. 1. Expo Go (an app used for mobile app development) doesn't allow interaction with the app I'm helping develop. Expo Go itself works fine on both the A15 and A25, but the in-development app would appear frozen. The in-development app works perfectly on Expo Go on the A01. 2. ** Edit: this issue appears to have been resolved, perhaps via one of the updates the phone received since I wrote about it. Original issue text: \"I set the \"side button\" (power button) to turn on the flashlight when double-pressed. Using the included camera app before using the side button to turn on the flashlight results in the flashlight not working. This can be fixed by clearing the camera app's cache every time you want to use the flashlight, or using a different camera app. For all I know there's a fix for these, but I haven't found it yet (and I've looked).\" 3. Some third-party apps fail to start and require a second screen tap. VALUE: This phone is exiting the budget segment toward mid-range, but you get more for your money compared to an entry-level phone. More computing power, more storage and memory, an ultrawide camera, stereo speakers, a better screen than the A15, while retaining a 3.5mm jack. *But \"the market\" wants big phones (see the Marques Brownlee video \"Small Phones are Dead and We Killed Them\" video for more).

I am getting 5G pretty much everywhere around LA. Everything works as expected, great screen, face recognition, fingerprint, google pay. Really impressive for a phone under $300.

            "I had no problems with activating this phone, mostly I think because I did it on Tracfone's website. Super-easy. This is not a phone for serious gamers, but that's ok. If all you need is the basics and you don't need blazing speed, this will suit your needs. Mine came with 3gb RAM. I added a micro-SD card for my add-ons, like wallpaper and photos. Be careful opening that SIM card drawer or the SIM card will fall to the floor. It happens so quickly you won't notice it and complain it didn't come with a SIM card. As mentioned by others, you will need either a charging block with USB-C opening to use the supplied cable, or get another cable that fits a USB opening on a charger or computer on one end & USB-C to fit the phone opening, which is what I did. No big deal and cheap enough on Amazon. Most folks have USB chargers laying around. You can increase the speed a little by adjusting the RAM-Plus setting in Device Care > Memory. It comes set at 2 GB but you can increase it to 4GB. It's a virtual memory trick. It does help, but it won't make a  gaming device out of the phone, which it wasn't intended to be anyway.  The battery lasts fine for average users. I say buy it! Read more",
            "My Samsung A20 (the higher priced phone) finally died on my after 2 years of use, so I opted for this A03s as a replacement. Much to my happy surprise, this new A03s phone is much better in every way than the A20!!  I couldn't believe it!  The screen is slightly larger, the processing of everything \"app wise\" is faster, the video quality is much better when viewing YouTube etc., and the camera is also much higher quality.  I also loaded all my favorite Apps from Google Play and every one of them works fine. ***Oh, my only gripe: It did NOT come with a charging cable I could use because my computer does not have a USB C female port. The cable Samsung includes is a white USB C Male to USB C Male, so you have male ends on both sides of the cable (I'm assuming Samsung assumed users would be connecting the phone do an Apple laptop or something). So, if you want to plug this phone into a standard USB Type A Female port, you'll need to buy a \"USB-C Female to USB-A Male Adapter\", but they're only $4-5 bucks on Amazon, so no worries there. Just be sure to buy one at the same time you buy the phone or you may not be able to charge it. Read more",
            "I bought this to replace my 8 year old samsung tracfone which i liked alot until it died. My review: Size: this phone is at least 30% larger than my old phone. Fortunately I do not carry it around often so it probably won't be a major issue. However, if you are looking for a portable phone that will fit in a regular pocket, be aware. Set up: tracfone support was useless. They wanted to send me a code to complete the set up, but my old phone was broken so they said they could not, nor did they offer any other options. Fortunately, my adult son switched the sim card from my old phone into the new one and i was able to receive the code on my new phone and complete the process. Without him I would still not have a functional phone. Charging cable: phone did not come with a functional charging cable and to use the one that was sent would have required another purchase. I ended up using the cable from my Fire tablet, which sufficed. Performance: as always there is a learning curve with new technology but so far i am feeling my way along with this phone. Don't expect to receive a user manual because one does not come with this phone. Downloaded one from the internet but it is poorly written and not user friendly. You Tube videos are available for some issues, however. So far the phone seems to be working ok. Lost data: i am still trying to figure out if I can retrieve my contacts, photos, etc from my old phone to transfer to new phone. I probably won't even bother to do this thru tracfone because I'm sure it would only frustrate me and make me want to kill myself. I will explore other avenues. Summary: inexpensive phone with some good attributes. B+ for the phone: D- for tracfone. Read more",
            "I had cracked the screen on my pixel phone, so i bought this as a replacement until i can get the pixel repaired. Its a bit sluggish at certain times, but way faster than i expected it to be. My use case is discord, sms, telegram, email, phone calls, insta and twitter. No gaming. It seems to do all that perfectly fine. Maybe not quite as snappy as the pixel, but its 100% usable. Camera and mic and audio is not great not terrible. I love this thing though, hell im tempted to just keep using it. Pro tip: if you are transferring your number and benefits from another phone do it through their phone tech support. Make sure you get a human to do it. Their automated stuff rarely works. Read more",
            "This is a Tracphone issue, not Amazon. Amazon gives you 30 days to return stuff and I have never had a problem with returns, this was 6 weeks. Worked great for 6 weeks then died. Because the A03s doesn't have access to the battery I couldn't find the imei number. No longer is a simple receipt enough to return something to the manufacturer.  Of course the imei was in the paperwork that came with the phone, but if I saved all the paperwork for stuff I buy I would end up on an episode of 'Hoarders'. 5 different cables and 4 different chargers, holding buttons at the same time to force factory reboot and still a black screen. Easy to use: It won't turn on, so that's a no Value for money: It refuses to turn on after 6 weeks, so that's a BIG NO Battery life: It seems to still be charging, so maybe ok, BUT IT WON'T TURN ON! So there you have it, back to using the phone with the cracked screen until I can save up enough for another phone. Read more",

            "I buy this series because I hate phone charging. I've had moto g power, moto G7 power, now chose moto g Play over the G Pure, because the battery was a 5000 not just 4000. I can't put it into the old cases because it is a quarter inch longer.  I put it in a leather fold over case because these phones are so long they could have a stress break if sat or pressed on, but with a glass protector and wallet case, no issues, wherever in the vehicle it falls or if your purse dumps.  Turn off the haptic touch or the vibration causes two of each letter. Everything loaded on with the USBC to USBC from an old g power, in seconds without wifi. The USB 3 cable came with my SanDisk extreme 1 tig water resistant solid state drive from Costco, which pairs perfectly to these. I paid around 180 each  for the prior phones but the trackfone $45 offer is awesome. I saw it did seem to have an unlock phone option on trackfone, but for 20 a month cash for card fills from Rite Aid, and truck wifi, so it never uses gigs, I'm staying with tracfone. I was sick of Verizon Xfinity overcharges on 2 phones, and this goes nicely with the cheap pocket size flip as a second business line, to carry anywhere, but you can still sign and accept documents on this nice phone. If a document comes in on the little flip phone text, you just forward the text to this G Play and do business.  This phone does everything thing the iPhones do that I'm interested in doing with no monthly contract or overages, just $20 period, unlimited talk text and 2 gigs data for emergency if you set to wifi only, and use your home or vehicle wi-fi to stream, FB, etc. You never need to speak to customer service ever again.

            "The Moto G Play 2023 (unlocked) cost me $100  and serves as a great replacement for my UlePhone  P13 with Andriod version 11. The Ulephone had failed due to a leaky battery. The Moto G was easy to set up. First, I opened up the box and noted that the user manual had a \"quick start\" manual that was too brief.  As per the quick start leaflet I put in the memory card and the sim card from my old phone. The battery showed a 60% charge so I immediately shut down the phone and charged it up to 100%.  Meanwhile I did a search for \"Moto G Play 2023 User Manual\" and downloaded the 62 page  (very useful) \"User Guide.\"  Be sure to get this manual (is is a pdf file) and it is full of  information.  The old SDcard needed to be reformatted and this manual tells how to do this. The Moto G has an Andriod 12 operating system and has \"VOLTE\" which is a requirement in our area for using the local AT&T cell towers. VOLTE give you more range and greater clarity than the old communications protocol. After about 90 minutes of charging I was at 100% and I did the initial; startup procedure  described in the downloaded manual.  The phone connected to the AT&T tower with no problems.  I made my first phone call and the sound level was more than adequate.  I have a hearing disability so I expect most people would say that the phone is 'loud.\"  I also downloaded a Kindle book  ($2.99)  that told me details about using Android 12. If you want the book  do a search on the Amazon site for \"Android 12 user manual\".  Most people will not get this manual but I am happy to have the extra information provided in this well-written book about the Android 12 OS.  I bought the Moto play because I needed a phone and did not care about playing games, reading kindle books, or \"living on the phone.\"  The Moto G can do all of that but you would be better off to buy a much more advanced unit that costs several time as much as the Moto G.  I much prefer using a separate (large) Kindle for reading, a  dedicated gaming computer,  and  desktop computer with multiple screens for other activities.  Overall, the Moto G does exactly what I wanted (a good phone)  at a reasonable price.  I also downloaded a few apps from the app store and they worked properly.  I rate this phone as being better than expected and well worth the low price. Read more",
            "Phone works very well.  Stylus is a great add on for those with large fingers. Unfortunately it's the weak link in this phone. After just a short while the stylus broke. It is quite easily replaced (and was) but the lifespan of the original wasn't great. The phone may not be the fastest on the planet in games but does well enough. Photo quality is okay overall. Quite good in daylight, passable in low light.  Battery life is okay, usually makes it two days before needing a charge. Playing games for hours on days off tend to lower the battery life to just a day. Purchased to replace a Samsung S-10A and the Motorola is a better phone.  A small complaint that the Samsung app store isnt available on Motorola. One or two apps for phone themes were lost in the change over.  After a few days of searching apps equal to, or maybe in some ways better were found and installed. Quite happy with this phone. Read more",

Takes good photos as far as I'm concerned. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's not as fast as my Motorola G Power was which finally died after 5 years.; but it's fast enough for me. In my opinion, Motorola has the best sound quality during phone calls and excellent battery life on everyone I've bought for the last 20 years. I would buy this again ! especially for the good price and current Android version updates. Read more",
            "Moto G Stylus 2023: Terrible Disappointment I recently purchased the Motorola Moto G Stylus 2023, and I must say, it has been a complete disappointment in every aspect. This phone fails to deliver on its promises and falls short in terms of performance, design, and functionality. Here's why I strongly advise you to avoid this device: Lackluster Performance: The Moto G Stylus 2023 is painfully slow and sluggish. It struggles to handle even basic tasks like opening apps or browsing the internet. The overall user experience is frustrating, and you'll find yourself waiting for ages just for simple actions to complete. It's as if the phone is stuck in the Stone Age! Inferior Build Quality: The build quality of this phone is subpar at best. It feels cheap and flimsy in hand, lacking the premium touch you'd expect from a modern device. The materials used are of low quality, making it vulnerable to scratches and damage. Moreover, the design is uninspired and outdated, making the Moto G Stylus 2023 look like a relic from the past. Mediocre Camera Performance: Despite the marketing hype surrounding its camera capabilities, the Moto G Stylus 2023 fails to deliver impressive results. The photos captured are often grainy, lack detail, and suffer from poor color accuracy. The supposed \"stunning\" low-light performance is nothing but a marketing gimmick, as the images turn out noisy and unusable. If you're looking for a phone with a good camera, this is definitely not the one. Frustrating Software Experience: Motorola's software experience on the Moto G Stylus 2023 is a nightmare. The device is loaded with bloatware, which not only eats up valuable storage space but also slows down the phone even further. The user interface is cluttered and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate through the menus. Updates are infrequent, leaving users stuck with outdated features and security patches. Lack of Display Quality: The display on the Moto G Stylus 2023 is a letdown. It lacks vibrancy, and colors appear washed out. The resolution is mediocre at best, resulting in a pixelated viewing experience. Whether you're watching videos, playing games, or simply browsing the web, the display fails to provide an immersive visual experience. In conclusion, the Motorola Moto G Stylus 2023 is an absolute disappointment in every aspect. From its poor performance and inferior build quality to its underwhelming camera and frustrating software experience, this phone simply falls short of the competition. There are far better options available in the market at similar price points. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere for a reliable and feature-rich smartphone. Read more",

            "I've been with Verizon for years and always bought new phones through Verizon. This is my first unlocked phone purchase. I'm on a Verizon Family Plan and the plan for all lines was upgraded to a 5G Unlimited Data plan not long after 5G went live. I stuck with my 4G-LTE Moto Z2 Play until now when I pulled the trigger on this Google Pixel 7 Pro (512GB). The phone arrived at my door delivered by Amazon Prime next day. After I first turned on and set up the new Pixel 7 Pro I turned it off then I took the SIM card out of my old beat up Verizon Moto Z2 Play and I dropped it into the SIM slot of my new Google Pixel 7 Pro phone, turned the phone back on, and voilà! The phone immediately connected to 4G-LTE initially and I got frowny face, but about 3 minutes later it automatically switched and connected to 5G with 5 bars and I got big smiley face. It's been a solid 5G connection ever since. It was just that easy-peazy for me. The phone is snappy and responsive. Phone calls are crystal clear and sound amazing. The screen resolution and picture is fantastic. Super HD quality when watching 1080P or 4K. The speakers of the phone on speaker-phone sound fantastic, and the speakers sound fantastic even when listening to music or watching a video. The volume goes up very loud and it still sounds very good with little to no volume distortion (depending on the source audio). Bluetooth devices are pairing perfectly and without issues. So far, all the features of the phone work great. Security seems tight and the facial recognition and fingerprints work flawlessly thus far. The camera takes extremely good photos and video and even in very low light they come out very good. I'm trying to think of negatives and I can't really come up with any right now—except maybe that there are a whole heckuva lot of settings of all kinds that you can adjust, which isn't really a negative at all, but it takes a long time to get it all dialed in on an unfamiliar phone. Security options are many which is a good thing. I'm very happy I pulled the trigger on this so far and I'm not quite sure what to make of the 'verified purchase' negative reviews because this Google Pixel 7 Pro rocks. I'll come back and change my rating if that changes. Read more",

Thank you very much and I mean that sincerely.

The zoom allows you to take pictures more clear than 20/20 vision.  I can take a picture of a sign that is far enough away that I cannot read it on my own, but the 30x zoom can read it clearly.  The stabilization at high zoom is pretty impressive as well.  The photo editing features are great also, particularly the unblurring and magic eraser. My only complaint is the battery - the battery life is ok, I can generally get through a day without charging, but it takes a LONG time to charge.  Like 3-4 hours to go from 20% to 100% on a wireless charging pad. I highly recommend the Pixel 7 Pro, but would discourage ordering it from Amazon.  Amazon sent me the wrong color (exterior bag was labeled with correct color, box inside was different color).  This was annoying but normally would not be a big deal.  However, returning this device has been a nightmare, with incomplete instructions and unresponsive customer service.  For some reason they do not allow the normal drop off process, perhaps because of the battery. The instructions made it seem like UPS was just going to show up randomly and ask for the phone.  I have not been contacted by them at all, not sure what to do. Read more",

            "Es mi primer Pixel. Tuve miedo de comprarlo porque siempre me basaba en la potencia del procesador y dejando de lado lo demás. Soy de usar gama media en los sectores altos o medios. La verdad, no me arrepiento en nada de comprar este Pixel pues he notado que es fluido, se escucha genial, el motor de vibración se nota premium y ni hablar de las fotos. Hecho en falta la carga o la duración de bateria, pero espero cambiar de a poco la costumbre de cargarlo por ratos en el día. Tampoco es como si se me terminará la batería en 3 o 4 hrs... Me ha durado al rededor de entre 7 y 8 hrs de bateria aprox. Y si lo cargo de ratos (15, 20 min), ni cuenta me doy de cuanta batería me queda. La verdad valió cada maldito peso jaja Read more",

PROS -Bonito diseño, se siente muy bien al tacto, la pantalla se siente con pocos bordes, buen brillo, muy buen touch y tiempo de respuesta al tacto. se siente muy pro desde ese sentido -la camara es muy bonita, hay que aprender a usarla pero saca muy buenas fotos desde el inicio, la camara selfie esta decente aunque no tan impresionante como la principal. - se personaliza muy lindo, buen interfaz -No he tenido problemas con Telcel aqui en MEXICO. funciona bien Puntos negativos o a considerar: - el tema del calentamiento, no tan preocupante como esperaba, vivo en Yucatán, México. y lo pedi en mayo con 42 grados C.  con sensaciones superiores, en esas condiciones cerca de las horas mas calidas si es preocupante si quieres usar la camara, en reposo no es tanto un problema, yo trabajo en aire acondicionado y tampoco se siente. El dia 1 mientras configuraba el equipo si lo senti caliente, pero con el paso de los dias y con el uso regular no es un tema preocupante, practicamente normal y eso que ha la clima ha sido igual de caluroso. ojo si lo ocupas para estar en un clima similar en exteriores mucho tiempo no lo compraria, en lugares con un clima mejor no creo que sea un problema en lo absoluto. - diseño super resbaloso, necesita funda si o si, yo pregunte en tiendas fisicas en  mi ciudad y no tenian, asi que les recomiendo pedirla en linea lo antes posible para usarlo tranquilamente. -el sonido es decente, no excelente, a mi no me molesta, sin embargo venia de un oppo con sonido estereo muy lindo y si senti la diferencia ----- Lo recomendaria, si un 100% y aqui con muy buen precio Read more"

            "The media could not be loaded. The phone is a powerful device that gives me a satisfying experience using it. It has 128gb of storage, which is enough to accommodate a large number of photos, videos and applications, while 8+8 GB memory ensures the smooth operation of the system and smoother multitasking. The equipped MT8788 processor performs well in daily use and gaming experience, allowing me to easily enjoy smooth operation and efficient processing speed. The phone has an IP68 waterproof design and can maintain normal operation whether it rains or accidentally falls into water. This gives me confidence to use my phone when doing outdoor activities or travelling. What amazed me the most was the amazing 10600mAh battery capacity. I used 3 days without connecting to the charger. It allows me to no longer worry about charging issues frequently. It can last long time after one single charge. However, even with all the advantages, first of all, due to a large capacity of the charger, the overall weight of the phone is relatively heavy, which makes it inconvenient to hold by one hand for a long time. I need to switch hand or hold by 2 hands after a while. Overall, I've had a great experience with the phone, and pros clearly outweigh the cons. It's high performance, waterproof design and long battery life make it more convenient for me to deal with the various scenes in daily life. Read more",

            "The media could not be loaded. Salut à tous, Bon, il faut absolument que je vous parle de ce nouveau bijou que je viens de choper, ce Téléphone Portable Incassable (sortie 2024), et franchement, je suis sur un petit nuage depuis que je l'ai. Alors, posez-vous tranquille et laissez-moi vous raconter pourquoi ce smartphone, c’est de la bombe atomique ! Déjà, rien qu’en le sortant de la boîte, tu sens direct que t’as entre les mains un truc de ouf. La prise en main est nickel, il est robuste, tu sens qu'il va pas te lâcher au premier coup dur. Les gars, c'est un vrai tank ce téléphone ! Incassable, c’est pas du blabla, c’est du solide, du costaud, du vrai. Fini les écrans pétés au moindre petit choc, là, on parle d’un smartphone qui résiste vraiment à tout. Et ça, ça fait plaiz ! Ensuite, son écran 6.52\" HD+ est juste parfait. T’as des couleurs vives, un bon contraste, et même en plein soleil, tu vois tout sans problème. C’est cool pour mater des vidéos, jouer ou juste surfer sur le net. L’écran est assez grand sans pour autant être encombrant, ce qui est top pour le glisser dans la poche. Franchement, pour la taille, c’est pile ce qu’il faut. Côté performances, c’est du lourd aussi. Avec ses 16Go de RAM et 128Go de stockage, extensible jusqu’à 1TO, tu peux y aller niveau applis, jeux, vidéos, photos, il ne rame jamais. Ça tourne comme une horloge, c’est fluide, rapide, aucun lag. Android 13 dessus, c’est un pur régal. L’interface est clean, simple à utiliser, et tu as toutes les dernières fonctionnalités au bout des doigts. Parlons batterie maintenant : 10600mAh, les gars ! Oui, vous avez bien lu. Autant dire que tu peux oublier ton chargeur pendant des jours. En utilisation normale, il tient facile trois, quatre jours sans broncher. Même en usage intensif, tu fais facilement deux jours. Et ça, pour ceux qui sont toujours en vadrouille, c’est le top. Plus de galères de batterie en rade à la fin de la journée, là, t’es tranquille. Le haut-parleur, c’est une autre tuerie. 128dB ! Pour ceux qui savent pas, c’est ultra puissant. Tes sons sortent clairs, forts, et même dans un environnement bruyant, tu rates rien. C’est parfait pour les appels en mains libres, la musique ou les vidéos. Tu te fais une petite soirée entre potes, tu peux mettre l’ambiance direct avec ce haut-parleur de malade. Côté photo, c’est pas en reste. Le capteur de 50MP fait des photos vraiment sympas, nettes, avec des couleurs fidèles. Pour les selfies, les photos de groupe, les paysages, tout passe crème. T’as pas besoin d’être un pro pour faire des clichés stylés avec ce smartphone. Même en basse lumière, il se débrouille bien, ce qui est plutôt rare à ce prix-là. Le truc qui m’a vraiment bluffé, c’est sa résistance. Il est antichoc, étanche, et tu peux même l’emmener dans les conditions les plus extrêmes. Il résiste à l’eau, à la poussière, aux chutes… C’est vraiment le compagnon idéal pour les aventuriers ou ceux qui bossent dans des environnements un peu rudes. Fini les téléphones qui tombent en miettes dès qu’ils touchent le sol, là, tu peux vraiment lui faire confiance. Ah, et j’oubliais presque, il est Dual SIM ! Si comme moi, t’as une ligne pro et une perso, c’est juste parfait. Plus besoin de trimballer deux téléphones, tout est réuni dans ce petit monstre. C’est super pratique et ça simplifie vraiment la vie. Pour la connectivité, t’as tout ce qu’il faut : 4G, NFC, OTG, et même Face ID. Le déverrouillage facial est rapide et précis, ça marche nickel même dans la pénombre. C’est vraiment un plus niveau sécurité et confort d’utilisation. En plus, avec le NFC, tu peux faire tes paiements sans contact, c’est super pratique au quotidien. Le design est aussi à la hauteur. Même si c’est un téléphone robuste, il reste élégant avec sa finition noire. Il a un look un peu agressif mais très moderne, ce qui en fait un smartphone qui a du caractère. Il attire les regards et les compliments, c’est sûr. Franchement, pour résumer, ce Téléphone Portable Incassable est une pure merveille. Il combine robustesse, performance, autonomie de dingue et fonctionnalités modernes dans un design stylé. C’est le compagnon idéal pour ceux qui cherchent un smartphone fiable et puissant sans se ruiner. Moi, je suis conquis, et je le recommande à 200% ! Si t’es à la recherche d’un nouveau téléphone qui envoie du lourd, n’hésite pas une seconde, fonce sur celui-ci. Tu seras pas déçu, parole de geek ! Read more",
            "The media could not be loaded. Das Handy wir mit einem Ladekabel (USB-C) und einen Netzteil geliefert. Ebenso gibt es eine Nadel um die SIM Karte herausholen zu können. Eine Display Folie ist schon vorinstalliert. Das System läuft sauber und flüssig. Alle Eingaben werden schnell und richtig erkannt egal ob Gesten oder multi Touch. Laufen tut das Handy aktuell noch mit Android 13. Das Display selber ist lässt sich sehr hell einstellen so das auch bei Direkter Sonneneinstrahlung alles noch klar lesbar ist. Was trauriger weiße nicht Standard ist bei einem Outdoor Handy. Und da es einen sehr großen Akku verbaut hat kommt auch mehr als nur 1 Tag über die Runden. Mit Musik ca 6 Stunden auf der Arbeit, etwas spielen in der Pause, abendlichen Servern im Internet und immer mal wieder paar WhatsApp Nachrichten Schreiben komme ich auf gute 2 Tage mit einer Akku Ladung. Es würden wahrscheinlich auch 2,5 Tage werden wenn man bis 0% wartet mit dem Laden. Die Camera macht gut scharfe Fotos und es sind alle gängigen funktion vorhanden wie Nachtmodus der sehr gut funktioniert ohne rauschen im Bild zu haben. Oder Panorama und co. Das Case was fest um das Handy herum verbaut ist, ist sehr massiv und Schütz das Handy aus jeder Fallrichtung. Selbst hinten bei der Camera ist ein abstehende schmaler Steg der die Camera und die Box vor Fallschäden Schutz. Hier wurde mal an alles gedacht und ist nicht auf Kosten des Gewichts gegangen. Es ist gefühlt nicht so schwer wie andere Outdoor Geräte die ich schonmal in der Hand hatte. Es wirkt etwas unter 400 Gramm und ist somit ungefähr nur doppelt so schwer wie ein normales Handy. Das Highlight hier ist aber mit Abstand die verbaute Soundbox. Man hat hier richtig klaren sound und einen hervorragenden satten Bass. Da können sich die großen namenhaften herstellter mal eine Scheibe von abschneiden. Alles in allem bekommt man hier ein sehr gutes stabiles Outdoor Handy für den kleinen Geldbeutel. Ich hoffe ich konnte euch mit meiner Rezension etwas weiterhelfen. Read more",
            "La batería del teléfono móvil es muy duradera. Lo compré para mi tienda, lo que soluciona el problema de que a menudo me olvido de cargarlo, porque su energía se puede utilizar durante más de 7 días. ¡También es rápido de usar, suena como un estéreo y es económico! Se me cayó accidentalmente dos veces, así que agradezco que todavía esté intacto y perfecto. Read more",
            "The extra large battery means it will last all day in full use, it is also a OTG which allows it to be a power bank to charge other device which is really cool. I have a lot less battery anxiety with this phone than any other flagship phone so far. I love using this when I am doing my DIY projects, the phone is tough and waterproof and will stand up to a lot of abuse from dropping and scratches from power tools and rough surfaces. I did have to rinse it under the tap a few times after getting paint on the phone and it did not skip a beat. Speaker stopped working when it is full of water but once I blow all the water off the back of the phone with my air tool the speaker worked again with not damage. It has plenty of RAM and processing power, playing mid tier games feels smooth and enjoyable. Streaming video and watching movie is great as it has the best audio from a budget phone, there were no sound distortion even when playing as loud as some external blue tooth speakers. The face unlock and the finger print unlock function works really well, there is no lag and instant access to the main menu. GPS locking is quick and nav app like WASE works well with this phone for driving. Camera takes good picture as long as there is enough light in the environments, the macro lens is really good for taking photos of close ups and as close as a few CM from the subject. The screen is bright and sharp, at full brightness I have no problem using it under direct sun light. It comes with screen protector pre installed and the phone does not need a phone case as it already protected by the rugged design. over all a fantastic phone for not a lot of money. Read more",
            "I am very happy to have this smartphone. The battery life of the smartphone I used before has always bothered me, but the battery life of this phone is very long and long-lasting. I often use the phone to work, which is very important to me. The other configurations are also very good.  Satisfied, the running speed is fast, the memory is enough for me, the voice call is very clear, very satisfied Read more"

            "I've had this phone for one month or so and it's without any doubt the best I've ever owned. I currently have a Samsung 23+, Pixel 8 (non pro), and they are not even close in regards to the pleasant experience this phone gives. Also I have not had any issues at all. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Android Auto, texting, calls, etc. all work very well. The speaker sound is excellent. It has a very nice screen and it's super smooth. It also has the silent slider on the side of the phone, just like the OnePlus 8T that I once had, which is very useful. The haptics are the best I've felt in any phone I've had before, comparable to pixel phones, however there are two separate haptic syles you can choose from, and they have adjustments for intensity. As for the camera, I have taken a hand full of photos and they are much better than expected. In my opinion, the photos are also comparable to the Pixel phone quality or at least very close to it; the camera also has a very good zoom if you need it. The UI is not stock Android but it's comparable in many ways, with more customization. There are a lot of useful features, such as different dark mode styles; natural tone display, which helps keep the screen color the same as the ambient lighting changes; ultra anti flicker (a huge feature for me personally), for if you are sensitive to PWM (this causes eyestrain and headaches); and many other unique features that are actually useful. Read more",
            "Disclaimer: I use this phone mainly to talk, text and peruse social media.  I don't do too many live videos or take a ton of photos. This phone does a great job in everything although it's really not a master in anything outside of battery life and charging options.  I get a full day out of this phone easily.  Usually around the 1 day, 3 to 5 hour mark before I charge each day.  I usually charge when the phone gets between 20-25%.  I can leave my house at 35% or even go to bed at 15% and never worry about running out of juice.  And even if I'm low on juice, I can charge this phone from 20-100% in about 25 minutes.  I am amazed at how I can put this phone on the charger and in just a matter of 5 minutes I've gained about 20% of power.  Even when using a USB charger, it's still pretty fast.  Wireless charging is about average.  That is the phone's biggest strength. As far as talking goes, it has a good quality sound.  Coming from a Samsung 20 FE (Verizon service), I found myself missing a call now and then (goes straight to voicemail) or drops in audio when I took calls at home.  I've yet to have a problem with the OnePlus, so I'm guessing the internal anntenna is better because I'm still with Verizon. There are a lot of audio playback options available (Dolby Atmos, Spatial, etc.) and I haven't tried them all out yet, but the speakerphone sounds loud and crisp.  However, when I connect to a Bluetooth speaker or in my car's audio system, the volume tends to be lower.  I have to really crank up the volume in my car or max out my Bluetooth speaker to hear clearly.  However, maybe there's an option I'm missing in the settings that would help me. And there are a ton of options in the settings!  It can be overwhelming to someone who isn't tech-saavy, but it's not as bad as it looks.  Most of the settings are basic on the surface, but if you go into the sub-menus then it will get more advanced.  But you can control things to enhance the already superior battery life to changing your refresh rate for smoother scrolling.  Just about everything else is typical Android stuff, but OnePlus has some nice features of its own with the Floating Window and One-Hand Scrolling. The phone needs a case.  It's not easy to this phone even with both hands.  I wouldn't advise anyone try it unless they have pretty big hands.  It will probably drop as you are texting.  But that's not a deal-breaker because cases are inexpensive. The media on this phone is smooth.  It looks really good and there are options to tweak it even more.  Someone who is an avid TikTok or IG fan will be at home with this phone.  The camera takes amazing photos.  Unfortuantely, I haven't been on vacation yet to give it a real try, but what I've taken so far are very nice.  Definitely a little clearer and more realistic than my Samsung 20 FE.  Recording video is pretty impressive, too, but I've yet to do a live or video call. Anyone who pays almost double for an iPhone or Samsung is really just seeking the brand.  Yes, those phones may have a few more bells and whistles with A.I. and they may have slightly (arguably) better cameras.  But if those phones are a 10 on a scale of 1-10 then the OnePlus is a 9.  And it is much, much more inexpensive to the point that you could probably get two of these for the price of an iPhone or Galaxy 24. Read more",
            "I was a long time fan of Google Pixel phones, but while the are good phones, they have some serious flaws that were always frustrating. Basically, Pixel phones suck at the most basic phone functions: making calls and the battery life. I briefly switched to Samsung, but the newest update made the phone unusable to me. Since I bought a cheap OnePlus model once, I was somewhat familiar with the brand, and I bough OnePlus Nord N30 for my wife (which is also a great budget phone). I was hesitant to buy OnePlus 12 because its price is well above the budget phone prices,  but boy I am happy I decided to take the risk. It has everything that Pixel and Samsung lacks. The Pixel may take the best pictures overall, but I am buying the phone not the camera, and this phone pictures are excellent anyway. The battery life is good and I have not experienced data or call issues yet. This phone just works, is solid, and is well worth the money. Read more",

This A25 5G is no exception and IS seen as one of the best mid-ranger phones in the market. My only quibble with this version (of two) for the A25 5G is its RAM size It's 6G , not 8GB (which I'd hoped for). The seller did not have option for the 2nd version of this model which comes with 256GB OF ROM (storage) and of course, 8GB of RAM (memory). Honestly, I would have been content with 128 GB ROM & more importantly, 8GB of RAM given that it has an external capacity for storage of 1TB via mini SD card.

Overall , I totally recommend this model if your not ready to pay the big bucks.  5 stars and Amazon did a excellent job of shipping. Read more",
            "I ordered this phone because my current one was starting to give me problems. I misplaced it and just found it and downloaded all my current phone info onto it. It came charged. While downloading, I noticed that I needed to begin recharging. The phone would not charge. No matter which charging cable I used, it would not charge. It is in essence a dead phone to me. I cannot use and no one can find out what is wrong since it can't charge. VERY disappointed and as an 86 year old, I am out $200. Very sad Read more",
            "I needed to upgrade to Android 13 for work, and figured my best bet was something slated to go until 14 as well so I picked this out as a fairly cheap option. Since then I have had waves of negative experiences with the software on the phone, and today capped it off with something that defies logic. When first setting the phone up, I was informed my PIN was too weak, and now needed to be 8 digits long. Alright, a bit weird but I can handle it. Then it maxed out at 3 fingerprints instead of my previous phone's 5, which has caused me minor grief because I've found that the fingers I chose to forego, index and thumb on my left hand, I actually used a fair bit more than I realized. Next up was the One+ UI, a disaster of an interface that took me hours to figure out how to bypass in favor of my typical layout. This comes packaged with an obscene amount of bloatware, and there's a hardware-based warranty void if you attempt to root to remove any of those apps, which I will never use and only take up space on the device. Fine, whatever, I'll adapt. Then it decided it wasn't going to connect to my PC with a transfer protocol, choosing only to charge itself from the connection. This was the first major issue with the phone, as I frequently moved files between my PC and previous phone and now am unable to do so directly, making file management a pain. There was one option I had left to work around this, a thumb drive with USB-A on one side and USB-C on the other, so I could connect it to my PC, drop desired files onto it, then connect it to the phone and offload them. A pain, but a workaround for the time being. And then it decided it didn't want to do mobile data after disconnecting from a Wi-Fi signal, requiring a full reboot to register that, yes, I do in fact pay a significant amount extra on my mobile plan for unlimited data and it should be using that. This would reproduce every time I disconnected from a Wi-Fi signal, until finally I opened the developer options and forced it to keep mobile data on even when on Wi-Fi. And then today I noticed the thing that finally bothered me enough to say something. I was transferring an album to the phone and happened to check the notifications pane, and it said it was charging the connected USB device. Let me repeat that: it was CHARGING A FLASH DRIVE. The drive was concerningly warm, and there was no way to disable it as the USB settings were apparently controlled by said flash drive. I checked online for any sort of solution or workaround, and found that this has apparently been the case since at least 2017 and Samsung has done nothing about it. This absurd misunderstanding of basic hardware is so far beyond what any QA should have caught, and if it's been part and parcel of Samsung devices for SEVEN YEARS then I'm done with Samsung's ecosystem. Y'all can keep your bloatware and atrocious programming; see how many customers it wins you. Editing this review on account of new developments; I now have grounds to take off the last pity star I was willing to give. The phone has started refusing to recognize its mobile data as an option every time it connects to Wi-Fi. I went so far as to order a new SIM card to see if that was the issue, but the symptoms have started to recognize on the new card as well. Given that I use this phone for work on the go, this is absolutely unacceptable. One star, fix your useless OS. Read more",
            "I wanted to love this phone. The size is nice, the camera was great for my needs, but the battery life was not as advertised. I discovered that I had received a dual SIM phone with a single SIM tray. I specifically wanted a single SIM phone, and nowhere in the description or pdf manual did it say anything about being dual SIM. I am returning the phone to Amazon. I just want other buyers to know how to check if they received a dual SIM phone as well if that was not what they wanted. You can check by dialing *#06#. If it is dual SIM there will be two IMEI numbers. And also be advised that you will have to buy a separate wall charger, as one does not come with the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G phone. Read more"

            "This is finally the best phone and carrier for under $60 dollars I've found, first the phone is very well put together and does not feel cheap, the screen is 6.5 inches and the device is thin and very light. When purchasing your phone plan there are things you have to remember and you won't be disappointed. As far as the data plans, always purchase the phone locked with the sim card already installed, all you'll have to do is call the toll free number on the box for activation and you won't have to worry about compatibility issues with a sim card, never purchase a sim card only. As for your data plan it will depend on your usage and what you expect, I purchased the Truly Unlimited plan but it actually is not unlimited, the way it works is the plan actually gives you 300gb of data and 5gb of hotspot data, in my case I only average between 61 and 71gb of data in a month so there is no way I'll ever use 300gb, in that sense I never have to worry about data. How are you using your data? If you are streaming 4k videos and gaming and constantly downloading you'll of course burn through the data, be sure to read all the details of your plan, it tells you that Truly Unlimited is 300gb, that should be way more than enough for Internet, music and you tube for a month.

            "I had moved away from Pixel phones after my Pixel 2 XL due to the price. After bouncing around from OnePlus to Motorola I'm back in the fold and VERY happy with the 7a. The things I was looking for were qi charging (hard to find in midrange phones), NFC payments, good battery life, and long software support. This checked all the boxes. Some of the pleasant surprises were the size (not too big), the clarity of the screen, and the camera. The camera in particular is EXCELLENT. The fingerprint reader is a bit inconsistent, but I've found that if I wet my finger and wipe it off the reader works every time. I've got pretty dry fingertips, so that could explain the issues I have with it. I don't have to store a ton on the phone, so 128gb of space is plenty for me to use the apps that I want and download music and movies for when I'm traveling. You're not going to find a better phone for the price. I got mine on sale for $399, which these days is the most I will pay for a phone. Read more",
            "I needed a Pixel upgrade. My old Pixel 4a is no longer receiving security updates. I liked the 4a, its size, and its clean interface. I selected the 7a as a replacement since it will receive security updates until May 2028. The 7a is a good replacement. It is roughly the same dimensions, but it is thicker and heavier. The 7a feels like there's something solid in your hand rather than a lesser toy. I suppose this is extra battery. The migration from the 4a to the 7a went well using the USB-C cable adapter supplied with the new 7a phone. But I have to complain that two critical programs were not migrated. The two programs (and their data) were for 2FA programs used at work. One was Symantec VIP Access, and the second was DUO Two-Factor Authentication. I turned off gestures and use the three navigation buttons like the old days. The buttons are obvious and intuitive, and I do not like swiping with gestures like in iPhones. 128 GB of storage space is good. Even with all my music, I have about 100 GB of free space. I cut-over service from my old phone using a single SIM. AT&T gave me the new 5G SIM card for free. It was painless. The Pixel 7a has Dual SIM Dual Standby (DSDS), which allows users to choose which SIM to use for calls, data, messaging, and other functions. I'm not that fancy. The phone continues to work well when tethering to a Linux desktop machine. I cannot comment on battery life since the phone is usually docked to my desktop computer. Now that my old 4a is a a hot spare, I'll be installing LineagOS on it. I like getting away from Android completely because of how intrusive Google is. I could not do it previously because I have to be careful when a phone is used for work. Read more",
            "I love this Google smartphone. It delivers a great and solid experience in everything it does. The processor is snappy and the navigation is flawless. I love Google and all the apps work very well in this phone. The size is right for me. Not too big or too small. The screen is very good but the speaker is weak in general noise conditions. Headphones or a Bluetooth speaker are almost always the best option for video watching. The camera is very good and accurate. it has plenty of options for daily picture taking. The phone performs very well during phone calls. The reception is very good and reliable. I am not an intensive app user and I don't find myself on the road often, but I find the battery usage high. And it is understandable, given everything that the phone is capable of doing. The fact is that daily charge is necessary. The charger is powerful and fast. I like this phone very much. It is a strong and modern smartphone that you can get at a more sensible price. Read more",
            "This phone is really good, the only thing I can complain about is the face recognition and fingerprint scanner but after about 2 weeks of use you can get the fingerprint scanner to work every time without issue.

            "I decided to get a new Android phone to replace my aging Note 9 which was going to need a bettery replaced after serving me well for almost 5 years. I am someone who despises the sound of Bluetooth for music so I knew I wanted to find something modern with a stylus and a headphone jack, since I also despise carrying an extra adapter around and want to be able to enjoy my music while the phone is charging without being forced to use Bluetooth. I didn't necessarily need or want a flagship when I went shopping for this phone, just wanted something mid range which supported the latest 5g, Wifi, and Bluetooth standards, and for a mid range phone, the Moto G Stylus 2023 doesn't disappoint. First a couple of potential negatives for some people: I knew I liked the stylus, but never used the remote function so the Moto G only having a basic stylus without the remote camera function of the Galaxies wasn't an issue with me, but, may be for some users who like the more advanced styluses such as the ones that the Galaxy Notes have. The only other negative I have noticed is that while the 50MP camera is great in bright light, it isn't quite as good as some others in low light, but it's far from the worst I have encountered in a modern phone. That being said, now that I have the potential negatives out of the way, I absolutely love everything else about this phone. It's comfortable to hold. The display is clear and crisp and I have no issues using it in any light level from bright daylight to a very dark room. The display is also great for watching movies and videos, and I had no issues doing some light gaming on it either. The battery lasts roughly 2 days with my relatively heavy use. Both cell and Wifi reception are excellent. I work in some very isolated rural areas  in the Rocky Mountains and this phone works in places where my co worker's brand new iPhone doesn't on the same carrier (Verizon in this case). No dropped calls or lack of 4g/5g service in many spots where his iPhone is useless. The 256 G of on board memory plus the ability to add 2TB more on a Micro SD card is another plus for this phone, my purchase price for it and a 1 TB micro SD card was a fraction of most flagship phones cost, some of which, including every iPhone ever made, don't even offer the option to add storage. Besides for support for additional memory, if you still like listening to music through a standard headphone jack, this phone doesn't disappoint. The sound is very good though the jack, and the onboard DAC and headphone amp seem to have a great frequency response and an extremely low noise floor and no evidence of RF noise or other annoying interference. Another unadvertised, yet pleasant surprise, which some people may be interested in, was finding that this phone has an FM radio tuner on board, a rarity for a US market phone these days. I tried it out and it performed surprisingly well, great sensitivity for pulling in distant stations and great selectivity which allows for pleasant listening when 2 stations are right next to each other on the dial. It even supports RDS which displays artist name and song titles, among other things, for stations which transmit that data. Overall, a very impressive product for the price, great job Motorola! Highly recommend this phone! Read more",
            "The price dropped about $100 so I decided to get myself the first new phone I've had in 4 years. The screen is noticeably better quality; with better color, and brighter, and its 120Hz refresh provides smooth video. The screen tech is the same as the top-tier iPhone & Samsung models.

            "I bought this phone specifically for its wide range of 4G LTE and 5G NR radio bands at an affordable price. The processor is snappy and as long you stick with normal day-to-day activities it and the RAM is more than sufficient. I wouldn’t buy this if you’re a gamer but almost everything else works great. Battery life? Outstanding. Upgrading from a Moto G Power 2020 the plastic back is annoying. I get people don’t like to see fingerprints but the shiny G Power back had a stick to it making it easier to hold. The back on this phone is very slippery and annoying to hold. But a thin silicone case solved that problem. For someone looking for a perfectly capable phone but doesn’t want to pay insane flagship prices I think you’ll like this one. Read more",

It didn't bother me much, but it's worth mentioning for those who might be bothered by it. Other than that, the product is exceptional! It arrived a day earlier than expected, great delivery! I don't regret my choice! Read more"

            "8/10/2022: So far, I'm still really enjoying my Pixel. A solid 4.5 out of 5. The biggest drawback so far is one I didn't mention originally: the charging time. It's not BAD, necessarily, but still slower than my previous 4-year-old phone. It takes about an hour to charge from 0% to 80%. The battery life hasn't been an issue, at least; I can get through a day on about 60% charge. I've gotten used to the fingerprint sensor, though it is still a little finicky. Regarding overheating, I regularly work in 90-110 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time, and I haven't had any glaring issues. It just gets a little draggy when it's hot. (And apparently, it won't let you use the flash when it's warm.) One great thing I didn't mention before are the haptics/vibration. I particularly like them in this phone for typing, etc. I can always feel it in my pocket when I'm getting a call, which I can't say for the last few phones I've had before this one. 8/1/2022: I've had this phone for only a couple of days now, but my first impressions are very positive. My previous phone was the Essential PH-1, which now has a shot battery, and my biggest struggle in finding a replacement for it was finding a device that was the right size. There are plenty of great phones for this price range out there, but almost all of them are all HUGE. Funnily enough, there's already a great review by another previous Essential PH-1 user, so I'll probably end up repeating a few of the same points. THE PROS: -The camera experience is MUCH better on the Pixel than with the PH-1. Google phone cameras have never failed me. -The stock-feeling Android experience is great and super snappy on the Pixel, and rather customizable. I love being able to activate dark mode on all of my standard apps. Besides that, it will be receiving updates for 5 more years. -The phone design is sharp and the Sage color is unexpectedly cool. The back feels like glass but is made of plastic, which obviously helps to make the phone feel as lightweight as it does. The buttons are nice and clicky. -I use Straight Talk as my carrier. So far, reception has been great, even compared to the Essential PH-1. -The size is NEARLY 100% PERFECT, but it borders on being just a touch on the tall side. I still like the shape enough that I don't mind a bit. I have medium-large hands, and I really wanted to stay with a slim device that fits comfortably in one hand and thrives with single-thumb use. -Some are concerned about the phone's 60 hz refresh rate. I've never actually owned a phone with anything higher, so as far as I'm concerned, the display is buttery smooth. THE MEH: -So far, I haven't experienced any overheating or bugs... with one exception. For whatever reason, my Pixel did not ship with the Magic Eraser tool in the photo editing app. -Battery life isn't exactly life-changing, but it'll get you through a full day's use after an hour's charge, no problem. Even intensive use doesn't seem to drain the battery too quickly. -The dual speakers are nice, but I noticed max volume is comparatively sorta quiet. THE CONS: -My only real nitpick with this phone so far is the front/display fingerprint sensor. After owning a device with a rear fingerprint sensor, it feels like a bit of a drawback. The PH-1's rear sensor provided instant unlock, whereas the Pixel's front sensor is barely slower AND a little finicky; sometimes, it takes a couple of tries for it to recognize my thumbprint. It works decently enough even with a screen protector, but like any fingerprint sensor, I wouldn't expect great results if your fingerprint is worn away at all. -It comes with a usb-c to usb-c charging cable, but no charger block. I highly dislike that trend. OVERALL, I am really enjoying the phone and hope it does hold out well for the next 5 years of updates. Even with my small nitpick concerning the fingerprint sensor, I love the camera, the lightweight Android experience, and especially the phone's size. Read more",

            "The media could not be loaded. It's all in all a pretty nice phone! Now I'm coming from Google pixel 5 which I won't sugar coat I absolutely hated! I only had the 5 because I broke my Google pixel 4a which I loved, the 5 was all around a horrible phone, the battery didn't even last half the day, like I literally always had to be around a charger, the phone felt hollow and cheap, just all around I hated that phone, but I absolutely loved the 4a the picture quality the battery life it was a nice budget phone. So I decided I was over the 5 and wanted to get the next budget phone and went with the sage green Google pixel 6a and I've had it now for a couple days and so far Im really enjoying the experience! It's a nice slick phone looks like it could be an expensive phone, the picture quality I already can tell is awesome, the battery lasts me all day I won't have to plug it in until I'm going to bed at night and I use it none stop literally the entire day listening to YouTube and podcasts while scrolling through social media, and shopping online. I only experienced the phone getting real hot and over heating the first day I received it, but I was doing a lot of stuff on it along with downloadong system updates and charging it all at the same time, so it did over heat and was moving real slow. I easily was able to fix that by stopping everything I was doing, stopping the downloads and letting the phone rest on charge for awhile and once it charged I started everything back up with it off charge and it was fine. Since then I haven't had any issues with it getting hot. The finger print reader isn't the best... That does get a little frustrating but doesn't change my over all feelings about the phone. Now before I had any Google phones I was a big android fan, I've given iphones a shot and just couldn't get into the limitations of the iPhones, but loved what they offered in picture quality I went to Google pixel because I wanted to try them all, got the pixel budget phone and felt like the picture quality was comparable to iphone while still having the android freedom and the price point was perfect (I break phones far to much to keep spending money on overly expensive phones). After trying the pixel I couldn't go back. I am now a big Google pixel fan! Are there things Google needs to do better on? Yes of course they definitely need to improve some things but over all for the price , the picture quality (which is a big deal for me, I love taking pictures!) and the over all feel of the phone you really can't beat it! I would recommend to everyone to give pixels a shot and the 6a is a good phone to try! 🖤 Read more",
            "Been a Pixel fan since I got my 3a, after having a Samsung Galaxy that was stuffed to the gills with third-party bloatware. After that, the Pixel's total lack of third party apps- it is a Google phone, after all- was very refreshing. I can see one reason that iPhone users like theirs. But Google stopped supporting the 3a a while back, and I like having the security and other updates from Google (Pixel phones are among the first to get these), so I looked around, and for me the 6a was overall the best choice. It DEFINITELY has better battery life than the 3a or any previous smartphone. Pics are good too; maybe not quite up there with the best phones, but very good. Runs all my apps seamlessly. So far, I have zero regrets, I would totally do this again. Read more",
            "This phone's primary drawback is the limited battery life due to a smaller 3,140 mAh battery And does not have wireless charging. The 6.2-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate falls short compared to other models. The dual-camera system performs well, capturing sharp and detailed photos. In MKBHD's camera test for 2022, This phone had the best average out of all phones. Don't like that it heats up sometimes and needs to restart but otherwise really like this phone and if you want a good camera for an amazing price this is the phone.

            "Pase de un Redmi Note 8 Pro a este Pixel y quedé satisfecho, el cambio más grande se notó en la cámara, batería y sistema operativo. Sus cámaras en verdad son de lo mejor que he visto, además de que al momento de subirlas a tus historias de instagram no pierden calidad. Hablando del sistema operativo extraño algunas cosas de MIUI, pero el sistema tan limpio es de apreciar y los extras que trae Android 13 llegan recompensar. Lo único que cabe recalcar es que yo vengo de una línea con Altan y no es del todo compatible con este Pixel, pero si usas Telcel o AT&T no sufrirás incoveniente alguno. En conclusión, es un muy buen teléfono para un uso moderado, el procesador que tiene es lo suficientemente potente para llevar las tareas diarias, sirve para el gaming por si se lo preguntan, pero para una mejor experiencia mejor compra otro teléfono con más hertz.

I haven't even scratched the surface on all this phone can do but so far, I'm in love! Great phone, fairly priced. Definitely recommend! Read more",
            "This S23FE was a great upgrade from my S9. Easy to import all of my contacts, apps, photo's & files. It took some time using the smart swith app for Android as I had thousands of photos but was all done in the app. It's much faster than the S9 but the easy to use of the android system. It is totally unlocked as advertised and connected to the Verizon network right away. FYI: get a new sim card rather than using your old phones existing sim card. The only issue I ran into was by using my S9 sim card it was registered to the old phone and discovered it was in the new S23fe which it didn't like. It stopped communicating with verizon. The techs at verizon fixed everything quickly and it now works perfectly all at no charge! The camera portion of the phone takes ok selfies and basic photographs. The zoom feature came out a little blurry. Not the best camera setup but the phone/texting and all apps function as desired. All in all I'm totally satisfied with the newest Galaxy model plus saved over $100 by purchasing online. Samsung quality. Read more",
            "This is a relatively high end Android phone, which is what I wanted. All the programs and apps transfered over,  but I had to put in many many passwords to get the apps to work.  Much of the phone is the same as my previous Android phone, but there are a number of things that work differently,  so there has been a learning curve.  I quite dislike the ads that keep showing up for various Galaxy apps.  They are intrusive.  Also, I like to be very organized about my photos, which this phone allows, but even though the old photos are in the Gallery,  they don't show up in the files system. Read more",
            "I got this phone on sale for $400 (Black Friday 2023). So far, it's been very good for the price. The chipset is simply blazing fast. Everything feels snappy on this phone. Opening and closing apps are quick. Animation is smooth and does not stutter. The build quality is amazing and feels good to touch. So good that I did not use case until I first dropped it (more on this later). One drawback this phone has is battery life. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor is power hungry. The battery, while theoretically big, is quickly depleted. I mostly use my phone for navigation (Android Auto wireless), YouTube video playback, browsing on Edge, or social media chatting. My Screen on Time (SoT) life is expected to be 7 hours when fully charged according to AccuBattery Pro app I installed since day one of owning this phone. That is my usage without gaming ever. Expect the battery life to go down to around 4 hours or even less if you game because gaming is extremely taxing on your phone. It also heats up quite quickly, probably because it's drawing a bit too much power than it should have (inefficient CPU / GPU). One solution I have working for me is by activating Light performance profile under Device Care settings. This decrease the performance unless you're gaming. For my use case, it's perfect because it doesn't overheat anymore. That 7 hours SoT figure is with this profile turned on. Expect it to be around 5.5 to 6 hours SoT without this on. So about me dropping the phone, it was when I was changing my car's tires. I was crouching, so when it fell, it was about 12 inches high. The floor was concrete, and it was not clean. This is the worst combination because dust and debris are really abrasive and can easily put lots of dents and scratches on phone. Surprisingly, other than two scratches (one big, and one small), there's really no other damage. I was using matte screen protector at that time, so when it ended up falling screen down, it did crack the screen protector, but the screen remains flawless to this day. I assumed it fell by its side frame (charging port side), then it fell face down. I did attach the photo so you can judge the amount of damage done by this accident. Read more",

            "It's heavier and a bit thicker than my Moto G which I had to replace due to broken screen. Wasn't worth fixing. It feels solid, dropped a couple of times and it survived, thankfully. Picture quality is awesome. Be warned, it does not have a headphone jack. Wish it did so that I could connect it to radios which do not have Bluetooth. Also, could not get the provider I wanted because their system did not have this on approved list yet. Had to choose another provider (Visible by Verizon.) ATT & Verizon recognized it with no issues. But, Spectrum did not (that's the one I wanted), neither did Metro PCS (T-Mobile), which both companies did sell the exact phone at a higher price, weird. Definitely faster than my old Moto G Stylus (2020), I can browse much easier and faster. And, the apps load up faster. I just think it's a bit too expensive for what it is. I maybe expecting too much, but battery life seems wanting. I really didn't put it to a formal test, but during the first days of setting up the phone I had to charge it a lot. Even now, I have to charge it once a day, and I mainly use it for using the apps to do minimal work. So, take my rating on battery life with a grain of a salt. Read more",

            "I bought this phone at the recommendation of a friend who is very happy with theirs. I'm someone who isn't picky about my technology... I just want it to be straightforward, reliable and affordable. I'd honestly just get a flip phone if it wasn't so hard to get by in today's day & age without it being the expectation now that everyone has a smart device, on them at all times. Well... this phone fits the bill and then some! First of all, the battery life is honestly baffling. I'm not joking, I drove 20 minutes with GMaps GPS running and arrived still at 100%. I was so confused, not a single percentage point? I just wanted something that didn't obnoxiously guzzle battery and got so much more! Not sure how long this level of performance will last with the limited knowledge I have on how to maintain it, but sufficed to say this is really amazing so far. As far as everything else goes, I upgrade my phone so infrequently that I really don't know how it compares to what else is out there... even if you showed me \"the specs.\" I'm sure it isn't the absolute best around, but what I can tell you is this: the call clarity is great, both handheld and speaker. Bluetooth connects quickly and stays connected. I can have a lot of apps and Internet tabs open and switch between them and not be waiting for stuff to load (don't worry, I clear them when I'm done). Oh and the camera quality is so clear! Long story short, everything that needs to work works, it works well, and it's pretty easy for a less tech savvy person like myself to figure out. The price point is what initially sold me. I paid only $250 for this phone and I feel like it was an excellent value. Most other devices I've seen online average nearly twice that cost, or are a similar/lower price but poor quality. Not sure what you'd get out of the more expensive ones, but I'm more than happy with what I've got here. TL;DR: if you \"just need a phone that works,\" get this one! You won't be disappointed. Read more",
            "Update: I no longer close myself out of apps (except just now, bc this phone has a twisted sense of humor). Like any new setup, it just took a little getting used to. For example, I added a screen protector, not realizing it came with one already on it. I don't expect to upgrade for quite a while, but when I do, I probably won't even bother looking at other brands. OnePlus is the way to go - the Nord n30 feels and acts like a much more expensive device than it is. Original: I had never heard of the OnePlus brand until recently, but they seem to have a very good reputation. The Nord n30 kept topping the list of best lower-cost phones, so I took a chance and I'm so glad. My old phone was glitching a lot, basically acting like it was on the verge of total failure. I wanted to get something of reasonable quality, and fortunately, Amazon lets you pay in installments with no interest. That makes a big difference when money is tight, and at the holidays in particular. It's thin and light, and the screen is about as big as it can get without being ridiculous. That's perfect if you're 40+ and don't see as well anymore. The downside is that if you happen to have small hands, it may take some getting used to - it's just the slightest bit of a reach. The display is bright and beautiful, and it's super quick with no lagging. If you watch videos or listen to music you'll notice that the sound quality is amazing, particularly with earphones. I take a lot of photos, so the camera was important too. This one is very nice and I've gotten some excellent pics of the cat (and really, what else are cameras for?). I tested it on notoriously difficult holiday lights at night, and it did very well. Looking forward to landscapes and snow scenes. And more cat. The only thing that bugs me is I keep accidentally minimizing apps by swiping too close to the bottom where the functions are. That's something you have to acclimate to, but hopefully I'll get there soon. Overall this is an excellent choice if you want a high quality phone that doesn't cost half a month's rent. Read more",

            "I  just received the Shark 8 today to replace the worst phone ever made. I won't talk about that though. My first impression of it as an underdog brand phone is that it looks very up to date and well built. It looks more like a $500 - $600 phone. Replace the brand name with with a top brand name and you wouldn't know the difference. It comes with a case that fits it like a glove and that has a slightly slick but slightly grippy texture. There are better cases but for a free added bonus case, it will work and keep the phone from getting dinged and busted up when it flies out of your hand due to your butterfingers or lack of coordination and you drop it. The screen saver that was in the box was a different story. It did not cover the whole screen and did not adhere and stick to the screen. I sent BlackView a message about it so I'll see how good the customer support is for this company and if they are going to send me the right screen protector. The Shark 8 is very responsive and fast with no lag whatsoever which was my main concern when picking another device. It sets the bar high for other budget phones in it's price range. It responds like it has 6gb or the advertised 8gb of Ram and there is a setting that you can toggle on that will expand the RAM and give you another 8gb only when it's needed. 8gb is the guaranteed RAM all the time and the up to 8gb is in reserve. I like the lack of bloatware without stripping Android 13's character. It's Android but not stripped to to the point where it's bland. It is just right and IMHO all phones should be equipped like this. Also the skin that BlackView put over Android 13 looks like a hybrid between Android and the other top OS the way the icons look and some of the unique features it has. The processor is fast enough that you don't have to say \"come on\", \"hurry up\" or start tapping your fingers waiting for it to load. It's instant. As soon as I tap the screen the selected option or link or whatever is selected is already loaded, this also applies to content selected on a webpage online. As soon as I tap something on the screen, it is loaded. If the part about being 4g was left out of the description on Amazon, you would think this phone was able to access 5g the way it performs online. It's that quick. Which brings me to my next point. What I don't understand is how the wifi hotspot that this phone broadcasts is 5g, why is it only able to access 4g data from my network? It should be able to access my carriers 5g network if it can broadcast a 5g wifi hotspot. That would make more sense. Another thing that doesn't make sense is that developer options was already in settings so I didn't have to tap build number x 7 but there was only 1 setting under developer options. Usually the are around 50-60 settings. It's not an Android 13 revision, it's a BlackView revision. I enable developer options on every phone I get to turn off the animations to make the phone respond noticably quicker but this device performs like the animations are already turned off. Overall I am satisfied with this device especially for the price. It does everything I need it to do when I need it to do it, not tap the screen and wait 3 minutes for it to respond. It doesn't get better than this in this price range. If I had my choice of phones that have prices up to $600, after experiencing this budget phone, I would skip over the competition and pick this one as a daily use device. Because at the end of the day it does everything the other 2 top brand flagship phones do with the same efficiency and speed minus a few small features. All in all I'm happy with this purchase and will most likely buy another BlackView in the future when and if the Shark 9 & 10 are released. Read more",

Im unsure if the issue I had was a malfunction specific to my device so I wrote a detailed review of the rest of my experience. My device was very sun exposure & temperature sensitive! 20 minutes of indirect sunlight I ended up with a white screen until I powered it off to let it cool down. Easily overheated in my back pocket & when overheated & not shut down hairline cracks started forming UNDER the glass & display started failing-digitizer became useless. OVERALL-Specs showed promise but performance was lacking big-time. First off its a foreign platform base that isnt customizable for the U.S.- so youre stuck with system apps measuring weather in Celsius pounds in kilos and metric system for measurements. battery charging & capacity is ok but depletes rapidly.  Boasts dynamic sound but falls short due to easily covered speaker output- sounds great against a flat countertop but on the go its choppy at best. seamless refresh rate for display- not so much. And good luck switching between apps (playing candy crush & someone calls you? it might not even ring-just show up as a missed call) large storage capacity & \"boostable\" memory? even when high performance memory was activated it still frequently dragged, lagged, and often restarted itself.

            "I generally use an Apple product but a couple days ago found out an SE2022 will not survive the Sanitary cycle of my LG front loading machine.  So I tried this product.  It has been a while since I used the android system anyway.  Set up was easy.  Used the cable.  All the apps worked (I don't use many, mostly auto locks, video and news media, etc.)  It set up with 5G Spectrum no problem but took about 45 minutes to fully operate.  I also had to restart three times to get a connection but don't know if it would have worked otherwise.  No big deal anyway.  This has a nice response, good screen, and acceptable performance.  Nice color and everything seems to work fine.  I like the ability to increase local memory with the scan cards.  Way cheaper than apple and you can take them out and plug into your local computer for very fast transfers and control.  Much faster than any other method for huge files.  The camera on this unit is fine.  Not State of the Art but hey this is not a pro camera anyway.  Want to do photos get the real thing.  This is just a nice machine for those daily snaps.  Seems we have gotten used to regular photos so this is OK.  One thing after having a small frame phone like the SE2022 this thing is huge.  It really doesn't fit anywhere.  And the screen use seems made more to get more on it than it does to make things larger and more readable.  The messages font seem to match the screen.  Very small or too large.  Just like the smaller phone.  The photos are nice, larger.  I bought this in \"acceptable\" condition, used saving about 260 from the list price.  It is worth it.  I would not want to spend list for it though.  I just don't use the additional features. Read more",

            "Of all the phones that I've owned, over past 25 years, this one is head-and-shoulders above all the rest!! Pros: 1. BATTERY LIFE... Motorola advertises 2 days runtime on a full charge, but my experience has consistently been that I get over 7 days of normal use on a charge, and I usually recharge when I get below 30%. [User hint: I've actually found that I get *lower* discharge rate if I leave Wifi ON !!  I know it doesn't seem logical, but it is quite repeatable... with wifi off, the phone discharges at about 0.5%/hour (12%/day); with wifi ON, it is about 0.36%/hour (8.6%/day) ... That's the difference between 6 days and 8 days between charges.  I can't explain it, but it is definitely true! ] In the past, I focused on phones with removable batteries, so I could install larger after-market batteries to extend my run-time; the 10,000mAh battery in my LG V20 gave me about 9 days between charges, before that phone stopped working... that is comparable with what I get with the 5G's built-in 5000mAh battery. 2. Pre-installed apps - this has been an on-going curse, especially with the miserable Samsung phones... My Moto G came with virtually *nothing* unwanted on it, and even the unwanted things that *were* installed (YouTube... and a couple others that I don't recall), I was actually permitted to uninstall, with no arguments!!  So there is no leftover garbage, pestering me to update... I am *ETERNALLY* grateful to Motorola for letting me remove what I don't want!!! 3. voice reception is excellent... among the best that I've experienced, as good as any Samsung phone that I've used. 4. Visuals (what the phone itself looks like) - not the most important issue, but the phone really *is* beautiful to look at!!  I've never actually cared about that with any previous phone. Cons:  [there really isn't much here] 1. signal reception in remote locations... it is not quite as good at picking up weak signals as my Galaxy S5 was, but most other phones weren't superb with that either... it was one reason that I hung onto the S5 as long as I did... when I'm hiking in Sunol R.W. (Cal.), 10 miles outside the city, I rarely can pick up a signal, even from mountain tops... that's a bit disappointing, but as I said, typical of many other phones/services.  I was hoping the 5G phone would be more sensitive. 2. screen resolution: 1080x2400 is rather low-end for a modern phone, but truth is, the phone looks great; even tiny text is readable, and icons are quite clear, so it's not that important to me...

I had the 2023 version and although this years Mediatek Dimensity 7020 is pretty much the same as last years Dimensity 930, the extra RAM (8 GB total) makes this device run smoother and faster. The screen is nice and bright. I love the battery life and the side fingerprint sensor and Face Unlock work a lot faster on the 2024 model. Thanks to Motorola for listening and adding NFC for easy Google pay. The Pale Lilac color is incredibly good looking and the vegan leather is so easy to hold and feels high end. I am also happy with the OIS camera, beyond solid. Glad I returned the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G for this. There were GPS and 5G signal issues and it was sooooo laggy while using my Amazon Flex Delivery App. This may be a mid-range phone but people think I paid double for it!! Read more",
            "I REALLY LOVE THIS MOTO G POWER 5G PHONE!!! I purchased my original Moto 5G in 2019 and for a very long time I was very hesitant in replacing it with a newer version. Even though I did consider briefly buying a Moto 7G Phone in 2022 but I just wasn’t impressed with the unusual changes Motorola made just to make it look and work “different”. However, when I first saw this 2023 Version I was very happy to see that a lot things were back to the way I remembered them before changes they made to the Interface were actually ones that I liked. Such as Swiping down on the Homescreen “twice” instead of “once” to Auto-Rotate the Screen, which I used to accidentally do all the time. I know that something like this is very minor but it’s just one of the many ways Moto rethought the Interface to be more user-friendly. IMPORTANT POINTS:  This Phone has a Three-Day Battery Life, which is truly excellent! The feel, the weight and the look of it is really nice and it fits in my hand and pocket perfectly. The Display Screen and Refresh Rate is top notch and the Performance is Fantastic! Another BIG PLUS for me is that it has a 256GB of Storage as compared to 128GB. Also this Phone still has a Headphone Jack (Yay!) and it comes with a Phone Charger in the Box, which the 2024 Version does NOT have. THE ONLY NEGATIVE: For some reason Motorola thought that I wanted to have Tik-Tok and another App already Installed and it was difficult to remove it. By the way, I heard that the Moto g Power 5G 2024 has A LOT more of these Applications ALREADY installed, which is absolutely something I do NOT want at all. NOTE: I intentionally did NOT purchase the 2024 Version of the Moto g Power 5G partially because of the “reimagined” Interface, nor all of the massive amount of ALREADY installed “Bloatware” I’ve been reading about. Also, since I am very concerned about Security, I did NOT want the New NFC (Near Field Communications) which would include my Credit Card, Tap to Pay and other Financial information on my Cellphone. Although, I would have liked to have the New Wireless Charging Feature but it was something I able to live without. Read more",
            "The information below still holds true.  However, after several weeks with this phone, I actually like it better than my Samsung A54.  When the screen is locked and off, you get these little information dots.  Based on the dot symbol, I can tell whether it is a text from someone, or just a notification from an app. I can touch the little dot symbol, it will give me a little bit of information.  I can swipe from that dot, to dismiss, close out or respond.  I like that.  Lastly, I have noticed the battery life is better than the Samsung A54.  Not fantastic like my old Moto G Power, that would last three days easily, without needing a charge.  But, this one last about 20% longer than the Samsung A54.  Other than that, both phones (the Samsung A54 works just fine), are pretty good for the price. ------------- This is an early review of the Moto G Power 5g-2023 model.  Just got it yesterday. First, I have a Samsung A54, that I purchased least Christmas season and it works fine.  No broken screen, no scratches.  But the battery life on it (the A54) did not impress my at all.  Felt the same about the Nord 10, which also is in perfect working condition. Realized that I had been spoiled.  By my 4 or 5 year old, Moto G Power 2019 or 2020 phone.  I could easily go three days, without having to worry about constantly looking at the battery state, with normal use. Yes, it still works, too!  Oh yes, I wanted a headphone jack again, which the Samsung doesn't have. Yes, I have blue tooth headphones (not earbuds), but a set of good corded earbuds, is easy to take out of your pocket and pop into your eye, when you are mobile. So getting the new Moto G Power 5g 2023, at $200 was what I was waiting for.  Here's what I have noticed: a. The screen is cleaner and brighter than my Samsung A54, at a lower setting. b. It is actually a little taller and thinner than my Samsung A54, and not at wide.  So it is easier to hold in my hands. c. Charging time is similar when I put them on two chargers of the same brand, type and wattage. d. The front facing camera lens hole is definitely wider on the Moto G, I barely notice it on the Samsung. e. Setup was very easy. I connected a USB-C, cord between the Samsung and Moto G, and all of my account information was transferred.  I could select NOT to transfer media from the old phone to the new one, since I had inserted, a micro sd slot into the new phone, with what media I always wanted to keep. f. The fingerprint reader is on the side of the phone, vs, in the screen like the Samsung.  Which I actually prefer. Here are the disappointments: 1. This phone is newer than the Samsung A54.  Yet, when I did the Geek bench Test series on it, the final results were that the Moto G Power 2023 is about 20% 'slower' than the Samsung.  Oh, according to Geek Bench, they have the same processor. 2. I'm only seeing a slightly better battery performance than the Samsung, which is very disappointing, because of the POWER name, that is slapped on it.  Definitely no where close to the battery longevity of my old Moto G Power 4g. 3. When I tested the wifi speed, the Samsung A54, downloaded faster, by about 20%. 4. This might be user error.  But I can't figure out how to get 5 app icons in a row, compared to my other phones.  The Samsung gives me a grid option, in home screen settings.  But I do not see that in the menu of the Moto G Power 2023, even though they 'both' have Android 13. Yes, I know 5g drains the battery faster than 4g, when all things are the same.  I didn't expect it to quite match my old Moto G Power.  But I was extrapolating that it would be at least 30% better than the competing Samsung A54, which last about a day, before I have to recharge it.  It seems 10% at best of an improvement. So if you have a Samsung A54, and you are looking for performance improvement, I would not buy this phone. BUT, if you have an older phone, like the Samsung A52 (which I had traded in for the Samsung A54), this is definitely a good upgrade at this price, since it was originally about $299.  Especially, if you don't want to have to be bothered with wireless headphones, or fancy 'tiny' wireless earbuds, whose batteries, barely last a few hours. Perception-Someone with 'wired' earbuds walking around in public, are because of industry image,  perceived as cheap.  That is the image that I want. Will I return them?  Nope, too much hassle and they do give me the headphone jack, that I wanted.  But I know that POWER meaning of the past phones, is not the POWER meaning of the newer ones. Attached photo, sorry about it being sideway.  The Nord plus phone is at the top (different wallpaper), the Samsung is in the middle and the Moto G Power at the bottom.  Same wallpaper because it copied over in the transfer. That's it. Read more",
            "This my 3rd Moto phone over the past 9 years. The bloat free OS is one of the attractions. I've never owed a \"high end\" phone and I'm really not sure what I'm missing. These so called budget phones work for me with speed and reliability. When I see an \"uptime\" of over 2000 hours, I know it's a rock solid phone. Really, the only time I re-boot is on an OS/security upgrade. The phone works well on Canada's Rogers network. I've had no issues crossing the border into the US. The camera works for my purposes and the Moto gestures are a great feature. The hatchet move to turn the flashlight on is used often as well as the rotate to start the camera. The only reason I replace these phones is the battery, like all phones they tend to lose their staying power after 3 years. I see no reason to replace batteries in old phones. I will continue to purchase Moto phones in the future. Read more",

The battery lasts a surprisingly long time. The face unlock feature works pretty well, and it comes with a case and headphones, which is a nice bonus. Plus, it's got dual SIM slots and expandable storage, which is a nice touch for a budget phone. This phone has a solid value for the price.

            "March 2024 update: Most software kinks worked out at this point, phone still feels fantastic to use. Definitely not the best battery life or most efficient processor, however it's still very fast and usable for everything, gaming included. Cameras really are spectacular - everyone I talk to loves the pictures I take with this phone. Good image processing too. List of pixel exclusive features keeps growing, definitely worth it for those. Idk what other people are doing when they are having issues getting their carrier to register on their phone - for me it took about 5 seconds during the setup process after transferring my SIM from my pixel 6 to the 8 pro, and it was all set. Phone is less of a toaster than my pixel 6, better cameras, feels faster - ill get back to this in a moment - better screen, lots of really cool software features that are worth spending the time to learn about. Does it actually feel faster? 100% yes - however you should remember that this is a brand new phone, and depending on what data you transfer over, it's going to take some time to \"relearn\" or recache your habits and such, so certain things are gonna load a little slow at first, but speed up a lot over time - this is expected behavior. Also keep in mind since it's still new, there are some bugs here and there that software updates will work out over time. I noticed a couple, nothing that majorly impacts my usage though. Overall, fantastic phone, really easy setup - esp if you had a pixel prior - I really like the shade of blue they used as well for the pro, good case choice can compliment it quite nicely. I do kind of wish the titanium was less shiny, but its not a big deal for me. Read more",
            "I got this to replace my 7 pro. I love it. The physical look and design are beautiful. Matte back, and the Google emblem is a different texture. Super speedy, and even though the screen is the same size as the 7 pro, you can see more as they extended the screen a bit more to the edges. It threw me off because I transferred all settings over from my 7 pro, and the font was a tiny bit larger than it was on the 7. No issues with battery life thus far. Really lightweight and sleek, just note that it's very top heavy because of the camera. Which brings me to my favorite part.... The camera is phenomenal. Before even opening the camera, I could tell it was quality. Just looking at the external lenses makes my inner photographer so happy. Long exposure and night sight both work great. Can't wait to see all the amazing moments I capture! I'm a hiker that makes online content, so being able to snap such crisp and realistic photos is super important for me. This phone delivers! I can't wait for the 9!! Read more",
            "OMG, the Pixel 8 Pro is, like, the coolest phone ever! 😍 I've had it for a few weeks now, and it's seriously lit. Here are some of the reasons why I'm totally loving it: Camera Game Strong 📸: The camera on this phone is next level. The pics I take with it are so clear and vibrant. Selfies, group pics, and even low-light shots look awesome. It's basically a mini photographer in my pocket. Speedy Gonzales ⚡: This phone is, like, super fast. Apps open in a snap, and I can play all my fave games without any lag. It's like having a little gaming console right in my hands. Gorgeous Display 📱: The screen is, like, amazing! It's big and bright, and watching videos or playing games is a total blast. The colors are so vibrant, and it's, like, perfect for binge-watching Netflix. Battery for Days 🕒: The battery life is, like, epic. I use my phone all day, and it still has juice left when I go to bed. No more worrying about it dying on me. 5G for Speed Freaks 📶: With 5G, I can, like, download stuff crazy fast and stream without any buffering. It's like the internet is on turbo mode. Android All the Way 🤖: I'm a big fan of Android, and this phone runs the latest version, so I get all the cool features and updates. Customization options are on fleek. Sleek Design 😎: The phone looks super sleek and modern. It's got a premium feel, and it's, like, total eye candy. Water-Resistant 💦: I'm not saying I've dropped it in the toilet, but if I did, it's nice to know it can handle a little splash. So, like, if you want a phone that's top-notch in pretty much everything, the Pixel 8 Pro is, like, totally the way to go.

            "My Huawei Mate 20 Pro started to have issues of randomly rebooting after three-plus years of use.  I first replaced it with a Google Pixel 7, but disliked it after two weeks of use.  The battery life of the Pixel 7 does not last a whole day and the touch screen is not sensitive after using a screen protector (I turned on the option to increase screen sensitivity).  I decided to give Motorola Edge + (2022) a try.  I had to pay $100 extra to bump the storage of my Pixel 7 from 125 GB to 256 GB, and this Moto Edge + (2022) has $512 GB storage!  It seemed a good deal.  I read quite a few reviews, and none spoke highly of this phone.  Now I have had this phone for about a month and I can report that I like everything this phone offers. This phone functions well as a calling device.  Good reception outside and it supports WIFI calling on the T-Mobile network.  By default, the WIFI calling is not enabled, but I got a message from T-Mobile with detailed instructions on how to enable it. That part was easy.  I also updated the system with 6 periodic updates.  At the time of this writing, the latest system update was from 12/1/2022.  I find the volume of the speaker decent, comparable to other phones my other family members or I have used before. The phone takes clear pictures under low light conditions.  I can tell that there are some software enhancements to the pictures.  Some people find it not acceptable, but I think it is probably a choice of personal tastes.  I am neutral about using AI to enhance pictures.  Overall, I think the camera on this phone performed better than my expectations. I like the overall design of this phone.  The layout of the cameras looks better than the Pixel 7.  I also find the fingerprint reader integrated with the power button a better idea than the on-screen placement.  It's much faster compared with the Pixel 7.  When I use Android Pay on this phone, it is much easier to unlock the phone with the outside fingerprint reader.  With all other features such as NFC, wireless charging, long battery life, 8 GB memory (can increase to 10 GB with onboard storage), 512 GB of storage, and a low price of $499, I definitely think it is a much better deal compared to Google Pixel 7 or even the pro version of it.  I haven't tried the Motorola Ready For functions, which can use the phone as a high-res webcam or a desktop computer.  They all sound like something useful and are surprises to me. Read more",
            "This review comes from the perspective of a person who has never owned a Samsung or Apple device. If you're reading this and it's not on sale, and you don't mind the big guys... Keep it moving. This phone isn't worth the asking price on build quality alone. But if you see this anywhere under 8 hundos, and you're ready to buy the optional 68 watt charger (moto made, and verified compatible) then read on my friend, and let tell you about this hidden gem. Build quality: Looks good, but can feel a bit cheap with the plastic frame. Buy a case and forget about it ( I got a Poetic case). The volume buttons are above the power button, you get used to it but still not the best configuration. The phone does heat up while gaming, charging the battery, and taking pictures. HOWEVER, after having done a throttle test, I can tell you that the heat management is very good, and the performance loss never dipped under 80% over half an hour, nor did temperatures pass 50c. Hardware: Screen is accurate but not bright, with slightly cooler tones out of the box. There are limited adjustment options available in settings. Direct sunlight visibility is just OK, definitely functional. The auto frame rate adjust is great and saves battery... But that 144 frame rate is buttery smooth. Signal : I'm on At&t, and initially assumed that I would be stuck on 4g. First I installed the sim, then At&t sent an update a day later and after resetting the phone 5G was available!!! No dropped or missed calls at all. Speakers are loud but a bit tinny until adjusted. Dolby equaliser should be set to film (surround sound) and pick the treble boost Sub option. Bass boost sub options are available as well. If you leave Dolby on automatic, they focus more on voices than music, so it's great for non music target. Battery life is pretty good on a heavy day, excellent for everyday use. Easily getting over 6 - 7 SoT, even with heavy use ( ex. hours of YouTube playback, Genshin Impact, taking pictures, and making calls) I haven't dipped anywhere near the 5's. The optional 68 watt charger has me topped off in a little less than an hour. Buy it, it makes the phone into a certified beast. This phone can also charge other devices when they are connected via USB c cable. Camera : physically very cool design, motorala's photo app is not so cool. Strange colour science they chose to roll with for photos. It is the phone's greatest weakness. Xda forums has a working version of Gcam alongside the. Xml config file. It changes everything! All of a sudden, you're in the big boy camera game too. And you can even change Gcam to the default camera for your moto gestures! gcam-for-edge-x30-edge-30-pro-edge-plus-2022-working-night-mode-face-retouch-config-file.4391919/#post-86297887..... This is a clue how you get there. Research how to use the xml file and where to put it. Good luck. Software : Its stock android with moto mods mixed in. The unlocked version doesn't come with a lot of useless apps. If you're obsessed with security updates then you won't like it.  You can use whichever launcher you want, but I think stock does a pretty good job. The software excitement comes with Ready For (aka Motorola Dex) Trust me guys n gals, it's legitimate and not a gimmick. I've played emulators on big screens, checked my emails with portable monitors, and basically made my laptop obsolete. It's that dang good. Plus it can recognise the display output of the device it's connected to and adjust. Get yourself a Bluetooth keyboard, a Usbc to hdmi cable, and a Bluetooth video game remote. The all in one experience is finally here, there, and anywhere a compatible device can be connected or cast to. Pro tips: Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec, and it makes compatible headphones sound truly amazing. I've found that Apt-X Adaptable can be a bit laggy on this phone, and honestly didn't change much more than normal Apt-X. Trust me, if you don't know anything about Bluetooth codecs and wonder if it's worth the hassle, just try it once for comparison and thank me later. The Motorola Edge+2022 has less available resources under this name as compared to Motorola Edge 30 pro. They're the same phone and can share the same resources. This will double the amount of advice and information you can find. Even though it looks like the sim tray can accept two cards... It can't. I tried. Developer mode . Change the animation speed to x.5, change the default Bluetooth codec, change the World. Don't play around too much or you'll brick your phone. Every time you connect a new device you'll have to check the Bluetooth codec option to change it. The phone should do it automatically after the first time. If you've made it this far.. Thank you for taking the time. If you do decide to buy this phone, I'd like to welcome you to a very small and exclusive group of people. We found our diamond in the rough, and with any luck it's going to carry us (with 2 major updates and 3 years of security support) into a whole new world of productivity and awesome. Hello 👋 Moto...

            "For techies, this is obsolete.  If you need the latest model with the most memory and fastest processor so you can impress your friends and family dog; this isn't for you.  For those of us who just want a mobile phone that can text, stream cat videos while you are in boring meetings, or play mindless games so you can distract yourself from what you are supposed to be doing, this is an inexpensive option.  It connects to wifi so you aren't burning minutes on your plan for things other than calls and texts  -if you have access to wifi and you set the phone to connect to wifi.  NOTE: The autocorrect keeps changing wifi to wife.  I suggest you don't set it to connect to your wife -unless you and your wife are into those kind of things.  No judgment. I've been avoiding cell phones for years, so I haven't kept track.  (Now I need a contract so I can confirm things with texts.  It's a conspiracy, man!!!)  I suspect this model was popular a few years ago.  Now it is out of fashion, but still entirely functional.  Combine it with a Tracphone $60.00 per year plan, and you are good to go for occasionally receiving/sending occasional texts, or having a means of contacting people when you aren't near your primary phone(s).  You can also disconnect in the middle of a diatribe, and then blame it on having an older model phone.  (I really miss \"hanging-up\", touching the disconnect icon just doesn't have the same closure.  Motorola needs to add a sound effect of a phone receiver slamming down when you disconnect.  Hmmm, now that I think of it, it may already exist.  Hmmm, if it doesn't exist, maybe I can copyright it.  Be right back, gonna check...  Dang! there are 103 sound effects to download.  I'll check them out later to see if there is a slamming phone receiver.  Don't steal my idea.) WARNING: This is a \"locked\" phone.  That means that you must use a Tracphone contract.  If you buy this phone, don't complain that an ATT, T-Mobile, or Joe's Budget Cell Phone Plan with free fries, doesn't work. <shrug>  Sorry, I couldn't rate Battery Life or Tech Support.  I don't use it heavily, and I don't have it off the charger for days at a time.  I haven't needed tech support. Read more",

            "Ok, this is NOT an $800+ smart phone, so no one should be comparing it to one.  However, it wasn't that long ago that if you spend any less than $250 on a cheaper phone, it was absolute junk.  This (when on sale) is less than $50 and it's perfectly usable for many people.  The screen is decently bright and clear even though it's not ultra-high res.  You get a basic amount of RAM (3 gig) And storage (32 gig) but you can add a micro SD card to that and use any number of apps that keep junk files cleaned out, etc.  One speaker, but you can't expect stereo for this price; it's decently loud, though. The cameras are average but in good light the rear one does really well - in lower light, not so much, but if you tweak the pics in a decent photo app you can make them better.  The selfi cam is serviceable.  Video quality tops out at 1080p and is also average.  Tracfone can be hit or miss - they are NOT known for their customer service skills, but generally speaking the service works and there are few outages compared to some others.  If you have an older person who just wants a \"use at times\" phone or a kid who needs their first smart phone, this won't break the bank (just PLEASE read up on parental controls on Android before handing one over to a tween/teen!!). Once again - \"for the price\" I rate this phone highly.  Just understand what you are and are not getting. Read more",

            "Before I bought this phone, I asked the following question and got the the reply from Tracfone customer service. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Does this phone work for AT&T network Tracfone is using? I know Tracfone is now Verizon but they still use AT&T network for existing customers like me. asked on November 16, 2023 Hi, No this phone is not compatible with tracfone/AT&T, is only compatible with tracfone/Verizon Network Customer Service, Tracfone -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- After I ordered and received this phone, I removed the SIM (already inserted in the slot and this SIM is for Verizon network only) from this phone and inserted my existing SIM taken from my old phone to this phone. My old existing SIM is for Tracfone/AT&T network. Unlike what Tracfone customer service claimed, this phone worked with Tracfone/AT&T network SIM without further doing anything. So, the phone is compatible with both Tracfone/AT&T and Tracfone/Verizon networks. It may be either because many customer service people are not very knowledgeable (not limited to Tracfone), the customer service person did not know this fact or Tracfone just wanted to hide the compatibility with AT&T to accelerate transition to Verizon network to avoid network usage payment to AT&T (if in the later case, it is a lie and Tracfone's practice  is very bad though). With Tracfone/AT&T Sim, Wifi calling can also be activated (You need to wait about 20 minutes before you see \"+\" mark on the lower right side of the Wifi status icon on the top right side of your phone). The phone itself is fine. My old phone is Moto G Power 2020 and compared to the old one, the 2023 version does not have significant overall improvements and just fine. Battery life is noticeably shorter than 2020 version compared at the same brightness. CPU/GPU is slightly faster but not much, so not snappy but acceptable. The camera is decent and suffers in darkness showing noises. But after installing GCam mod, photo quality improved a lot. To turn off or reboot the phone easily, swipe down \"twice\", then you will see a power button icon on the lower right corner. Tap the power icon and select power off or reboot etc. Overall, Moto G Power 2023 version is a good buy for the money spent. Read more",

            "I attempted to use this phone for one week and finally gave up. It drops GPS on major highways. It also intermittently drops internet. It takes a restart to restore GPS and/or internet. The phone gets very warm when using maps. 3 hours of use on talking on the phone used 70% of the battery's charge. (There are times in my work I need to be on the phone for 6 to 8 hours with remote support. This phone would not meet this need). It is very slow and often unresponsive. Especially after a restart. The camera was average. There were at least two apps that I had on my old phone that were not compatible with this phone. (Yaata was one of them. I don't remember the other one). The sim card tray is a very poor design. It felt like it was going to break when trying to get it out or put it in. The phone came with 2 screen protectors, the sim card tool, an average case, a charger and head phones. I liked the on screen keyboard. It had arrow keys to move the cursor and true caps lock key. Save yourself time and money and find a different phone. Read more",
            "The phone tries to be a Motorola X40, and wants you to believe it, but it is definitely not a Motorola. The information at the top barely fits in the bevel, there is little to no data, you can't turn notifications off for the pre-installed bloatware, the wifi is terrible, and the thing is almost unbearably slow. It takes at least 2 minutes to install anything from the app store. Opening something takes forever. For example, when I opened my Gmail app it took 3 seconds before opening, then another minute before it loaded everything. Another 45 seconds to open the email I tapped, and a minute for that to load. I don't need a super high speed phone, I only really use it to communicate, but it barely handles that. Getting a new phone as quickly as possible Read more",
            "First off I had to pry the sim slot out after I searched for my old pin key bc it doesn't even come with one. I tried so many times I thought it didn't open at all. Phone crashed after spending 30 mins setting it up. Then owner only offers amazon credit so I had to contact Amazon nd go thru all of that rediculousness. Case is stoopid cheap and useless. Phone had some kind of nasty white something caked on it I had to scratch off. Owner knows product is defective and put a sticker on the back of Phone so you know how to \"fix it when it crashes\". camera seemed decent but not the specs listed. Video record flash doesn't stay on. My regions bank app isn't even compatible. It is unlocked to tmobile but it's useless if it crashes. Data seemed okay at first but as soon as I downloaded my apps it was done. And I'm an android user so it wasn't like I had 30 apps or something. Sticking with my crappy blu33 Phone instead and that says a lot bc it's unbearable. Don't waste your time. Learn from our mistakes! And for God sakes don't cut off and old line thinking you can simply pick up this one. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for letting this seller remain on the app. I canceled my prime membership for good bc of it!  If we don't hold these major companies to a higher standard they will continue to handle business in this matter. Now I've gotta worry that my banking info is stuck on this phone and being returned to a seller who obviously can't be trusted. Read more",
            "Not at all what the description says it is. You can't ask for much buying a $100 phone, but this phone hardly has any of the qualities in the description. The camera is not 50mp by a long shot. My old 2019 phone has 13mp and it still gives better picture quality. This phone might be 5G, but it's extremely slow. You get the bare minimum in all aspects. My old phone was also $100 and yet it's still better quality than this phone. This phone is good if you want something temporarily, otherwise I recommend either paying a little more for a better phone or buying a BLU phone. BLU is also sold on Amazon and offers decent quality budget phones. Read more",

Some apps will run without lag, some more demanding apps will lag. I did not buy the phone for gaming or Facebooking, I got it merely for making calls, texting and checking emails. However, I had to exchange the phone for another one because I was seeing dropped Bluetooth connections and Internet too. Turning off WiFi (or data) and turning it back on always solved the issue but imposed an unpleasant burden on the user to constantly monitor connectivity and resetting the communication channel every time connectivity was lost. That was unacceptable which forced me to exchange the phone. The new one works fine. This model has the usual power-button double-tap to open a camera which is very useful when you need a picture fast. Standard slot for a micro-SD memory card for expansion etc. One of the useful features that I found missing on this phone was screen double-tap to wake up. However, that was not a deal breaker. Also, check the dimensions before you purchase. Be aware that when you buy this phone, you are getting a \"ping-pong paddle\". It is large. I could not find a normal-size phone to fit in my pocket because Tracfone does not support those anymore. (some other providers offer normal pocket-size phone models) Read more"

The battery life is not even close to what is advertised. The camera is terrible even compared to a Samsung or IPhone from multiple years ago my iPhone 5c I had a long time ago had better camera quality. The worst thing is my screen just decided to absolutely conk out and be unresponsive to touch and is entirely unusable like if you have a messed up video cable on an old vcr kind of look there was no accident to cause this either it was working and then just did that within a second I was using it when it happened. I tried to do a repair on it with phone repair tools as well and the outer glass they used is so thin and cheap is shattered when I was removing it to get to the actual screen I wasn't using a lot of force or an improper tool either. I've only had it for 6 months maybe too and for it to be complete destroyed when I've done nothing but take proper care of it is horrible I wish I could get a refund but I doubt I will. Also after about a month of use the OS will start to malfunction and give you error messages and massive freeze ups and loss of function without reseting the phone even then it sometimes persists.

            "Amazon’s description “AT&T 4G only, AT&T 5G not supported” is not correct.  I’ve confirmed that the Nokia G50 can connect using 5G on AT&T’s 850 MHz band 5, which AT&T says is now available throughout much of the U.S.  This likely gives a download speed about twice that available through AT&T’s 4G LTE.  So although this is true 5G, it does not offer the tremendous increase in speed available at much higher frequencies (but also much shorter range) such as 39 GHz, which AT&T calls “5G+”.  The Nokia G50 does not support such high frequencies for any carrier, and as a practical matter, carriers are beginning to deploy these high frequencies in only a very few locations.  The Nokia G50 does support a mid-range band for 5G used by Sprint and T-Mobile, which provides higher speeds than AT&T’s low-band 5G, but Sprint/T-Mobile now offer this only in select cities. Regarding the Nokia G50, I can only compare it to my previous Nokia 6.1, which AT&T obsoleted when they discontinued 3G.  (4G data still works in the Nokia 6.1, but voice telephone doesn’t).  Anyway, my first impression is that G50 has a much snappier processor, apps and data transfer are much faster, and battery life is much better.  I’m very pleased with the Nokia G50. Read more",
            "My wife uses android exclusively until this phone arrived. She tried to like this, wanted to love it like her Motorola died after one year. Reviews are mixed, some good and bad, phone looked nice. I used Nokia phones many years. I appreciated user interface, quality, design and functions. What she liked: 1.Facial recognition is flawless, never failed to unlock her phone, good color. 2. Price is reasonable. 3. Large screen and color. 4. Updated to Android 12 out of the box. Unfortunately some backed up items were deleted and settings changed during the backup. Three days later finally found correct settings. What she didn’t like: 1. Button designs on both sides are too easy to mistakingly touch. A case reduced inadvertent button use, but they should be a few MM higher on both sides. She accidentally turned it off during a call. 2. Fingerprint Sensor, I think is on the side, not bottom or face. She didn’t use it or activate that feature. 3. Dropped calls. This is common issue with all cell phones. This one dropped two or three calls each day suggests hardware problem. As a side note we live in a small apartment never had this happen with my cell phone or her previous Android. Opinion: I used android many years, 2002-2012. For personal reasons I changed to Apple IPhone for better Securit. Android programs require access to private info etc. Android system is decent, interface is intuitive, my issue allowing programs access to private data. Words with friends for instance is valid reason to access contacts. A different game program needed access to contacts, phone and email or it would not work. Her last two android devices were hijacked through a coupon website. We had to factory reset and slowly delete backup data info, cookies, programs. Installing virus protection discovered five hacking cookies we could not delete. Norton isolated and deleted them in minutes. Android OS versus IOS is subjective choice/preference. I’m not slamming Android or promoting IOS, they both have issues. In summary this Nokia phone didn’t work for us. Read more",

La pantalla es irresponsiva le tienes que picar varias veces para que haga lo que quieres o cuando utilizas el teclado no registra lo que presionaste o registra otra cosa y por último (esto es mas del sistema Android) eliminaron los botones de home y back y los hicieron expresiones lo cual lo encuentro frustrante debido a que cuando estas estás haciendo scroll en una página o app luego la cierra y junto con lo irresponsivo de la pantalla ya se imaginaran. En conclusión no vale los 5000 pesos que pague, este no es un teléfono de gama media ni siquiera gama baja, no sé a qué mercado va dirigido este equipo pero la verdad nadie se merece estas malas experiencias de un teléfono bastante lento y sin nada en especial.

            "Viene venduto come un supporto per Doogee T10 Plus, un tablet da 10.51\", ma arriva in una confezione dove viene riportato (come mostro in foto) che si tratta di un supporto per iPad, quale modello non ci è dato saperlo. Io personalmente l'ho usato con un iPad 9th gen, da 10.2\" e lasciandogli la cover. Avendo già un articolo simile, l'ho potuto confrontare con esso. Ebbene, da tale confronto è risultato che questo supporto è meno stabile rispetto a quello che possedevo, a causa della base circolare (a parità di spazio occupato in lunghezza e larghezza, una base circolare poggia su meno spazio rispetto ad una quadrata), ma soprattutto delle dimensioni inferiori e del peso più ridotto. Tuttavia si tratta comunque di una stabilità adeguata per quanto mi riguarda, nulla da comprometterne o peggiorarne significativamente l'utilizzo, a fronte di benefici dal punto di vista del trasporto, in termini di peso e volume occupato in uno zaino. Ho trovato particolare il fatto che il piedistallo centrale possa ruotare, ma finora non ne ho visto una particolare utilità, dal momento che mi pare più sensato girare la base intera, vista la sua leggerezza, e visto che così ne è meglio regolabile l'angolatura rispetto a noi. Naturalmente il braccio del supporto è ben regolabile in altezza e angolazione. L'aspetto e il colore di questo articolo son carini, e i materiali sono buoni. Nei punti di appoggio del tablet, sono presenti dei gommini per proteggere la scocca di quest'ultimo. In definitiva si tratta di un buon prodotto, senza infamia e senza lode, ma personalmente non lo consiglio da utilizzare per un tablet di medie/grandi dimensioni, visto che si possono trovare alternative più solide e stabili, a prezzi simili.

            "Am not a power user or someone who lives on their phone. So can't rate the hi tech features. Phone is mostly for occasional or emergency use, and don't much care about camera capabilities. My last phone was a budget phone, so this was a quantum leap upgrade. This one seems to first and foremost to have MUCH better reach to the tower, granted the 5G capability likely has something to do with that. First cell phone ever which works at my house, and I'm using the cheapest service provider there is here in the States, which I can't name here. Battery charges up fast, standby time is a lot better than my old phone ever was when new. Touch screen when scrolling and virtual keyboard and reorientation is snappy. Really like the adaptive brightness. Know most all phones now have wi-fi enabled calling, even my old phone once did but when changed service providers they no longer supported on the antiquated handset. Wi-fi enabled calling works GREAT on this phone. When my antiquated DSL isp was down recently, I actually used the 5G Samsung A54 as a hotspot for my computer. Like the size, personally find the glass back to be very slippery, I'd been just as happy with a hi quality plastic back. One thing worth noting is Samsung promises upgrades for several years. This was a new phone model in March of 2023, AND Amazon offered a 90 day return policy. Very important as needed to make sure would work with my service provider. Thought was they might need to send a new SIM card, and by that time return window could close. Happily, no problems old SIM card plugged right in, and presto phone was working within minutes. Also for a great price, this is brand new handset, not one which was supposedly \"refurbished\", used, customer return whatever.  Has a recent Android version, so wasn't buying some phone already out of date when I got it, like my last one was. (Samsung Galaxy J3, was a good little phone for the money and served well). Note the charger brick is not included, although the type C charging cable is. Most people probably have a spare charger or two laying around, but not in my case. Work around was: used the AC adapter for my MacBook Pro until got to the store and picked up a charger brick for the type C cable. Also got a legacy USB2 cable to Type C usb cable which allows the use of older AC charger bricks or older car cigarette lighter adapters. All in all two thumbs up, I mean what is not to like!

            "Never had a samsung b4.  But i must say I am suprised by the performance of it.  Has a good lock screen, good compatibility.  The touch screen is perfect. Has a fantastic camera most amazing is that the battery last me for 2 days. Overall a very nice and good phone.  I recommend it. Read more",
            "I am not a fan of spending on $1000 on something that has to be replaced every few years.  So, I buy midrange phones, keep them until they're not longer secure or the battery starts to choke. This is a much better phone than the price suggests.  Decent camera, good features, and a nice, snappy, responsive interface.  Also love the fact that these still take an microSD card. I didn't realize until I was done that they provided a transfer cable to move data from my old phone to my new one.  I also didn't realize the transfer software copied everything from my old SD card, which was unnecessary and took a lot of time. I would have given it 5 stars except for a few things: 1. No headphone jack 2. The fingerprint reader can be kind of iffy 3. Samsung keeps nagging me to get an account on their cloud and use it for backups.  Why?  That's what Google is for.  I don't need more snoopers on my machines. Overall a good, practical phone for everyday business use. Read more",
            "I got this phone after my iPhone XR broke and so I was a bit hesitant to switch over to android but I do not regret it. I'll make this to the point so I don't waste your time. Pros: - Battery life: I've had the phone for about 2 months now so I can't speak too much on the degradation but the battery on this is very good. On a full charge this will last me pretty much all day with maybe about 10-20% left at night with heavy usage. If you don't plan on using this phone all day you will be more than fine with the battery on this thing. - Multitasking: I can run multiple apps on this thing with no problems at all. I think the only time the phone might be overworked would be if you were video editing or gaming plus also trying to run something else at the same time but i'm not sure who would even do that lol. -Screen: The screen quality of this phone and with the high refresh rate makes it great for viewing at all times. I will say on a very sunny day you will have to turn the brightness all the way up to see but apart from that I have no complains about the screen for this phone and I think at this price range you won't find much better. Cons: - Camera: Now this one is definitely debatable as i've seen some people like and dislike the camera on here but for me I just feel like it's lacking in certain areas. The selfie camera is usable but coming from the iPhone I felt like it was pretty much the same with a little worse video quality. I will say the portrait mode on the camera is really good and the main camera is generally very good for the price, although zooming in at all past 2x will be pretty bad image/video quality. I do want to reiterate though this might depend on your preferences so id encourage to go find camera comparisons out there but I think for casual photography/video taking and with good lighting the camera will get the job done. -Finger print reader: Outside of the camera this was my only other nuisance with the phone, and don't get me wrong this is a first world problem but sometimes the finger printer reader lags behind or I need to get a good finger placement on it. It's not the biggest deal in the world but it can be a bit annoying having to scan my finger multiple times to get through. I don't use facial recognition so I can't speak on that but for the finger print reading it's definitely not as responsive as the higher end Samsung phones. Overall there is very little complains I have about this phone and I think for anyone who's looking for just general phone use you won't get much better than this and you're getting a phone with a reliable brand in Samsung so in case something happens it will be serviceable easier than maybe some other international brans out there.
